The frontier moved westward as the forests of the Adirondacks, Catskills, and Alleghenys of the eastern seaboard were cleared and inhabited. Euro-American settlers pushed across the continent, through the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, until they reached the Pacific Ocean. Although the actual travels of explorers, government surveyors, and settlers can be traced through the changing locales in landscape paintings, such depictions were to a certain extent idealizations. In the romantic-realist tradition of the Hudson River school, artists emphasized the primitive character of the wilderness and presented the newly cultivated farmlands as agrarian oases divinely blessed by rainbows and golden mists. <BR>Artists and writers promoted nature as a national treasure. However, the wealth of the land was measured in commercial as well as aesthetic terms. Railroads and axes appear in paintings as symbols of civilization, yet they also were instruments of destruction. <BR>According to some, the nation was preordained by God to span the continent from coast to coast. In 1845 the editor John Oâ€™Sullivan coined the term â€œManifest Destiny,â€? referring to the countryâ€™s duty to annex western territories and exploit their resources. The same railroad tycoons and land developers who promoted such a policy also commissioned artists to paint epic scenes of the American landscape. Manifest Destiny ignored the rights of Native Americans, who had inhabited the region long before European settlers arrived. Consequently, it is not surprising that Native Americans are absent from, or stereotyped in, most of the painted views of the land they called their home. The West seen in most nineteenth-century paintings was largely one of the imagination.', ''),

Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. <BR>Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions.

But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this â€œnew paintingâ€? was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.', '');

Flowing rapidly north to Lake Ontario, the Genesee thunders down three major waterfalls in a deep gorge at Rochester: the ninety-six-foot High Falls downtown; the twenty-five-foot Middle Falls little more than a mile downriver; and, one-third of a mile further, the eighty-four-foot Lower Falls. Removed from the greatest concentration of the one hundred mills and factories that lined the river during Frederic Churchâ€™s 1848 visit, the Lower Falls presented the most impressive site to draw and paint that the young artist had yet encountered.  American landscape painters customarily spent summer and fall traveling to find and sketch scenes for paintings that would be completed in the studio during the winter, usually for exhibition the following spring. Church was, and remained, especially interested in waterfalls and sought them out over the course of his 1848 travels, which took him to Connecticut and southern Vermont in July and August, then on to Rochester during September and October, where he worked out his ideas for a painting of the Lower Falls. He executed seven highly detailed and annotated drawings representing every feasible vantage point of the site, the most studies of any scene he had completed up to this point in his career.  While Church was drawn to the Genesee River region by the legendary falls themselves, it is quite likely that the scenery around Rochester had been recommended by Churchâ€™s teacher and mentor, Thomas Cole (1801â€“1848). In 1844, Church had become the first pupil of Cole, whose reputation as the leading American landscape painter was firmly established. From 1844 until Coleâ€™s death in 1848, Church maintained a close professional relationship with Cole and was influenced by his masterâ€™s ideas about landscape painting. That Cole had worked in the area in 1847, and produced the dramatic painting Genesee Scenery (Rochester Memorial Art Gallery, Rochester, New York) for the American Art-Union exhibition and distribution of 1848, would have been important to Church. Coleâ€™s rendering of the powerful cascade, which dominates the center of his painting, and of the lush surrounding landscape resonates with Churchâ€™s composition for Lower Falls, Rochester but also reveals how Churchâ€™s approach departed from Coleâ€™s.  Less allegorical and spectacular than Coleâ€™s landscapes, Churchâ€™s early paintings were generally thoughtfully ordered, panoramic views of rural landscapes. Lower Falls, Rochester is an exception, and a careful study of this pivotal early work reveals how the ambitious Church developed views of landscapes that would suit not only his own aesthetics and interests but also those of his prospective patrons. The view of the Lower Falls is methodically composed with precise rendering and detail, but it is also unusually contained and focused. The eye is immediately drawn to the center of the canvas by the flash of white-painted water rushing out of the gorge and over the falls to the basin below, where the frothy rapids quickly dissolve into the serene surface of the Genesee River. This focal pointâ€?coinciding with the identified subject of the paintingâ€?forms part of the strong vertical axis that divides the picture into nearly symmetrical halves. This axis is completed by the mill nestled above the falls and the reflection of the white water in the river below. The rocky bluff bathed in rosy late-afternoon sun on the left counterbalances the cool, shadowy glade atop the cliff at right. The landscape opens up gently, as a book along its spine, enveloping the small boy in a white shirt fishing in the sun-splashed foreground, and the viewer as well.  The first owner of Lower Falls, Rochester was Cyrus West Field (1819â€“1892), Churchâ€™s good friend and emerging patron, who purchased the painting in 1849 upon its completion. Field, whose fame rests now with his successful promotion of the first transatlantic telegraph cable, made his fortune in New York City as a dealer of fine papers and specialized in tinted papers manufactured by the best mills in western Massachusetts. One of these was owned by Churchâ€™s father and uncle in Lee, Mass., very close to Fieldâ€™s summer home in nearby Stockbridge, Mass. Field traveled to the Berkshires frequently for business and pleasure, and he and Church likely became friends around 1844, when Church was a student of Coleâ€™s. As Fieldâ€™s fortune grew, so did his interest in the arts, and the two visited with each other during the art studentâ€™s sketching trips to Connecticut and Massachusetts.  The interconnectedness of Fieldâ€™s and Churchâ€™s professional and personal interests during the artistâ€™s formative years played a significant role in the art that Church produced (and Field collected), including influencing Churchâ€™s interpretation of the Lower Falls at Rochester. Churchâ€™s topographically and geologically accurate rendering of the Lower Falls site corresponded not only to his artistic interests in impressive natural phenomena but also to the mid-nineteenth centuryâ€™s general enthusiasm for nature and geology, an enthusiasm shared by Field.  During this period, sentiments of national pride and progress were integrally tied to perceptions about the inherent marvels of the American wilderness and the wonder of its taming. Church turned his powers of observation to the flow and patterns of the water and the layering of the gray-green shale and red sandstone in the walls of the gorge, whose corresponding colors and locations he noted on his drawings of the site. A comparison of Lower Falls, Rochester with stratigraphic maps and photographs of the falls reveals the precision of Churchâ€™s geological observations. Churchâ€™s other major painting of 1849, West Rock, New Haven (New Britain Museum of American Art, New Britain, Conn.) also depicts a geologically significant siteâ€?and it too was bought that year by Field. Clearly, Church was astutely aware of the types of paintings that would appeal to his new patron.  For both Church and Field, waterfalls symbolized the perfect balance between untouched natural splendor and a growing industrial civilization, which harnessed their power for mills. Yet Churchâ€™s decision to stress the physical reality of the impressive Lower Falls required him to take liberties with man-made elements, primarily the numerous mills and other structures which existed around the falls, and which appear in several of Churchâ€™s drawings. In both the final preparatory drawing and the finished oil painting at least four buildings that should appear directly to the right of the mill have been omitted. Additionally, the vantage point selected for the painting of the gorge fully obscures any view of the Middle Falls with its cluster of buildings, enabling Churchâ€™s ideal composition.  The result, however, is that the central mill portrayed in Lower Falls, Rochester is embraced by the surrounding landscape, nestled into the woods yet prominent. Though not identified definitively, this mill is believed to be a paper factory, of significance to both Church and Field. By removing the other structures, Church prevents the landscape from being overwhelmed by industrial architecture and instead naturalizes the presence of the mill. In keeping with an important aim of nineteenth-century landscape painting, Churchâ€™s painting encouraged the (male) viewer in particular to be transported, especially through the inclusion of the boy fishing, from the busy existence of an urban and professional world to a harmonious environment, one seemingly more rural, carefree, even idyllic and timeless.  Field purchased this painting from Church at the most profitable and busiest moment to date of his career. By the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848, Field and Co. had accumulated a tremendous fortune and Fieldâ€™s business activities had reached an intensity level soon considered dangerous by his doctor. Rest and recuperation were ordered, and Field and his wife prepared for a five month vacation to Europe beginning in April 1849, exactly when the pictureâ€?a marriage of the restful and the industrial that perhaps expressed Fieldâ€™s hopes for his own futureâ€?would have gone on display in the Twenty-Fourth Annual Exhibition at the National Academy of Design, which Church had joined the preceding year.  Yet Lower Falls, Rochester was not exhibited there, or elsewhere. Instead Church, the youngest Academician in the organizationâ€™s history, submitted three different landscapes: A Mountain Tempest (no. 38), based on a poem by Childe Harrold and The Plague of Darkness (no. 82) representing Exodus 10:21, the texts of which were excerpted in the exhibition catalogue, and Fieldâ€™s West Rock, New Haven (no. 131). West Rock, New Haven was a larger, more complex American landscape than Lower Falls, Rochester, and depicted a geological site more familiar and historically significant to the National Academyâ€™s traditional New York City/New England audience. There is also evidence that another aspiring landscape painter, David Johnson, was with Church in Rochester in 1848 and painted the Lower Falls as well. It is Johnsonâ€™s painting, View at the Lower Falls, Genesee River (present location unknown), that was exhibited and for sale in the 1849 exhibition (no. 216).  Perhaps wanting neither to compete with his colleague nor follow too closely in the steps of Cole, whose Genesee Scenery was exhibited only the previous year, Church must have decided that the sale of this particular picture to Field was personal and professional satisfaction enough. Churchâ€™s intellectual and artistic approaches to the Lower Falls site represent his earliest attempts both to interpret the splendor of a major waterfall within its surroundings, natural and man-made, and to create landscapes of particular meaning and significance. The enclosed, almost private view of the Lower Falls and the paintingâ€™s relatively small size and intimate feel differ markedly from the highly public, large-scale paintings he soon began to create. Once Church traveled to South America in 1853, with Field, his expression of the landscape changed. The balance between man and nature shifted, as wondrous natural phenomena came to fully dwarf any human presence. Immense paintings of such sublime marvels as Niagara Falls and the exotic mountainous landscapes of the South American Andes resonated not with one specific patron but with thousands who paid to be astounded by the professed amazing naturalistic details of these works.  Lower Falls, Rochester was a crucial essay for the young Church, from the record number of preparatory drawings, to the subject matter, to the careful choices he made concerning the painting and its effects on his artistic and professional development and patronage. It was not exhibited publicly until 1966, when it hung in the first major retrospective of Churchâ€™s paintings held since the Metropolitan Museum of Artâ€™s memorial exhibition of 1900. It remained in the Field family until the mid-1970s, a testimony to its appeal to Field and his descendants.  Lower Falls, Rochester was one of seven paintings in the landmark 1994 Charles C. and Elma Ralphs Shoemaker bequest of nineteenth-century American paintings to the museum. It fills a major gap in the museumâ€™s representation of Hudson River School paintings, being the first, and only, work by Church to enter the American art collection.

During the third quarter of the 19th century, landscape artists such as Heade combined accurate, naturalistic detail with brilliant illumination and a sense of order and harmony to create timeless, silent images that seemingly defy their specificity.   Among Headeâ€™s most prized works are his views of the salt marshes around Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island, along the New Jersey coast, and in Newburyport, Massachusetts.  Rhode Island Shore dates from the artistâ€™s first stay in Providence, in 1858, when he initially turned to the theme.   The site â€“ Church Cove in Mount Hope Bay looking toward Mount Hope â€“ was rich in historical associations.  This was the place where King Philip, the chief of the Wampanoag Indians, died in 1676.  Although his death marked a critical point in the subjugation of the Indians of southern New England by the European settlers, the landscape as it appeared in the mid-19th century offered no hint of this past conflict.  Yet the 19th-century public would have been well aware of the siteâ€™s significance.  The serenity of the scene also belied the actual turbulence of Headeâ€™s own era.  Through such hushed images as Rhode Island Shore as well as other placid harbor views and picturesque scenes of the Eastern coast, luminists offered the American viewing public a sense of order and clam at a time when heightening political, social, and economic tensions were erupting into a bloody civil war.   Headeâ€™s marsh scenes, of which Rhode Island Shore is the earliest known example, are panoramas of flat terrains punctuated by small mounds of hay.  Most of the marsh scenes are small in scale, presented in a narrow, open-ended horizontal format.  The sky, often in dramatic sunset hues, usually dominates at least half of the composition.   All is meticulously painted, the brushstrokes barely discernible.  Nothing is allowed to distract the observer from the simplicity and order of the tautly composed landscapes.  Even humans are absent, although the haystacks signify the presence of an important industry derived from the marshy swamp area.  The scenes gain their quiet power from the abstract relationships of horizontals and verticals, a limited vocabulary of harmonious contrasts.  Although the views often appear airless, they are about light and atmosphere.   Because Rhode Island Shore was the first of Headeâ€™s marsh paintings, it does not strictly conform to his later, more characteristic haystack scenes but instead suggests affinities to the earlier Hudson River School aesthetic from which it emerged.  Larger and squarer in format, the scene is also livelier and more atmospheric, with the view framed by a large dark tree on the right.  Yet the elements that are the hallmark of Headeâ€™s mature art and the quintessential luminist approach are already present.   Through the generosity of the late Charles and Elma Shoemaker, the Los Angeles public can now enjoy Rhode Island Shore in all its delicate splendor, a gentle reminder of our nationâ€™s nostalgic desire for tranquility.', ''),

Spence . . . . In his cool palette, evocative sky, and turbulent sea Birch reveals the influence of Joseph Vernet (1714-1789), a French marine painter whose imaginative works were available to the artist in Philadelphia. Although Birch was actually depicting the aftermath of the storm, he still conveyed its power through the vigorous waves, overcast sky, brisk wind, and the narrative element of the destroyed ship. Although some of Birchâ€™s stormy marines were fictional, at least two, the museumâ€™s painting and The Loss of the New York Packet Ship Albion, exhibited 1824 (unlocated), were based on actual events. The schooner John S. Spence was lost at sea not long after it had left the port of Norfolk, Virginia, bound for Havana, Cuba. The museumâ€™s painting was commissioned by Alexander M. Peltz, one of the passengers on the schooner during its last voyage. At the age of nineteen Peltz, desirous adventure, left his home in Washington, D.C., and on August 19, 1827, set sail from Norfolk, Virginia, on the Spence in the company of a childhood friend, intending to travel to Mexico to join the company of the former US commodore David Porter. Six days later the schooner was wrecked in a storm on the open sea, its bowsprit and taffrail broken, and its masts transformed into a confusion of ropes and broken wood. Five survivors, including Pelz-but not his friend-were rescued a week after the wreck by a New England captain, Isaac Staples of the brig Cobosse Contee, but only three lived to reach New York.  Peltz originally intended to give the painting to Captain Staples, his rescuer. Staples was lost at sea before the painting was completed, however, so it remained in Peltzâ€™s family until 1982. Shortly before his death Peltz wrote an account of the voyage, disaster, and struggle to survive without food and water. Birch no doubt based much of his rendering on Peltzâ€™s oral account, for the written account demonstrates that he vividly recalled the details of the disaster.  When the painting was exhibited in 1834 at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts it was listed as a second view. Birch used the incident as the basis for an engraving that appeared in the 1836 volume of The Token; however, this drawn The Wreck at Sea is a close-up view from on board the Spence rather than from the distant perspective, and it depicts only four men being rescued.', ''),

Only a decade before, Manship had finished studying at the American Academy in Rome, which concentrated on classicism.   The young artist, however, quickly transformed the old tradition into a vital language expressive of a new age and consequently became Americaâ€™s premier modern sculptor.   According to classical mythology, Zeus, the king of the gods, fell in love with the beautiful Phoenician princess Europa and assumed the guise of a bull the seduce her.  Initially frightened, Europa eventually climbed onto the bullâ€™s back and was carried over the sea to the island of Crete, where the two made love.  Europa bore Zeus three sons, one of who was Minos, the future king of Crete.   Manship, visiting the Boston palazzo of art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner, was inspired by her Titian painting of Europa and created the first of three works devoted to the theme.  Flight would be the last and most elaborate of the Europa sculptures.  Despite the antiquity of the Europa story, Manship rejected any sense of classical serenity in his design, preferring to convey the speed of the modern era.  The overall composition of the bronze, with its open base and emphasis on diagonal lines, contributes to a sense of buoyancy.  Even though the bull is massive, it appears to leap effortlessly through the air.   The dolphins beneath the bull symbolize the Mediterranean Sea and the flight to Crete.  Manshipâ€™s interpretation surely was stimulated by frescoes depicting dolphins and men leaping over bulls that he saw during his visit to the excavation of the ancient Minoan palace of Knossos in 1924.  Manship had long been intrigued by figures in motion and by the early 1920s was already presenting them seemingly airborne.   The sculptureâ€™s delicately gilded surface and original beige-and-white onyx base not only demonstrate Manshipâ€™s love of expensive materials and rich surfaces: above all, they illustrate his exquisite sense of taste.  Nothing was overdone.  The decorative linear detailing, which became Manshipâ€™s hallmark, is limited to small areas: Europaâ€™s coiffure, Cupidâ€™s wings and hair, and the bullâ€™s mane. Even his approach to the story is one of decorum: Europa sits upright, her legs crossed in a ladylike manner, calmly listening to the words of love being whispered into her ear.  No hint of violence or abandon that would suggest a rape is included.   Only five casts of Flight of Europa have been located, and this is the last one to enter a public collection.  This piece was so cherished by Manshipâ€™s devoted supporters Edwin and Sarah Holter that it remained with their descendants for more than 70 years.  Through the generosity of the American Art Council, its members, and the Shirley Filiatrault Trust, the museum has been able to add this major sculpture to its collection.', ''),

By the end of the war he would create approximately thirty oil paintings of New York bedecked with displays of banners and flags as part of the home-front effort to inspire patriotism and help raise funds for war relief efforts. Fifth Avenue was often decorated, and for the Fourth Liberty Loan Drive in the autumn of 1918 it became known as the Avenue of the Allies, each block from Twenty-fourth to Fifty-eighth streets being devoted to the flags of a particular Allied country.  Hassam painted five pictures of Fifth Avenue during this celebration. In the museumâ€™s version the artist depicted the block between Fifty-fourth and Fifty-fifth streets, on which Brazil was represented. The flag of that country, a yellow diamond on a ground of bright green with a blue orb in the center, appears not only as the large flag waving in the center of the composition but also directly to the right and in a large grouping of flags to the left. The block south of Brazil was devoted to the British Empire and the one north to Belgium, so Hassam shows the New Zealand flag flying in the foreground and the flag of Belgium, a threebanded design with black on the top (Hassam always used dark blue), yellow in the center, and red on the bottom, flying behind the flag of Brazil. The flag of the United States also appears several times, hanging from buildings and in the distance across the thoroughfare. The painting closest to this one is Avenue of the Allies, Great Britain, 1918 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), in which Hassam depicted almost the same section of Fifth Avenue looking uptown but from the west side of the street rather than the east, so that the configuration of flags appears slightly different. The two versions share Hassamâ€™s use of architectural components -- tall, sheetlike buildings -- on both sides of the picture to frame the flag scene.  Street scenes were far from new in Hassamâ€™s oeuvre, for he had been fascinated with the hustle-and-bustle of the urban crowds since his early days in Boston. In the earlier images, however, figures usually assume a larger role. In the flag paintings it is the flags, not the figures, that are of primary importance. In the series Hassam experimented with the view, point, depicting the street from varying elevations-street level, slightly higher, above the flags, and even rooftop viewpoints. Hassam no doubt was inspired by the flag celebrations painted by Claude Monet (1840-1926) and other French impressionists, and his first flag paintings were watercolors done in Paris in 1889 during festivities for Bastille Day on July 14.  The flags increasingly became the main source of movement and decoration as the series progressed, as they not only became larger but also were more prominently placed. In the paintings from late 1918 such as this one Hassam viewed the flags from below to emphasize their size and positioned them in or near the center of the compositions against a pale sky to form a lively, two-dimensional pattern of colors and designs above the pedestrian-filled street. While the large flags strung across the street wave in the wind, a sense of air and movement is conveyed equally well through the pale palette and exceptionally sketchy, even unfinished surface.  The museumâ€™s painting was often exhibited during the years right after the war as part of Hassamâ€™s flag series. In 1919 an unsuccessful attempt was made by a committee of New Yorkers to purchase through popular subscription a group of the flag paintings as a permanent war memorial. The lithograph Avenue of the Allies, used as the frontispiece of A. E. Gallatinâ€™s Art and the Great War (1919), differs only slightly from the museumâ€™s painting in the details of a few of the foreground figures. William Preston Harrisonâ€™s overwhelming enthusiasm for the art of Hassam, rather than his patriotism, may have been the crucial factor in his decision to purchase this painting.', '');

A large part of the workâ€™s attraction to students of American history has been the fact that it appears to stand out among Ash Can school paintings as a statement of strong social criticism. This interpretation has been derived not so much from the appearance of the canvas as from the fact that it is very similar to the drawing Why Donâ€™t They Go to the Country for a Vacation? 1913 (LACMA), executed by Bellows for the socialist journal The Masses and published as the frontispiece of its issue of August 1913.  Almost all the Ash Can school artists who contributed to The Masses stopped short of creating outright political statements. For the most part, they simply considered themselves to be realist artists, producing vignettes of urban life that fit with the journalâ€™s alert, down-to-earth editorial tone. Their consciously artistic, realist drawings of indulgent social satire are distinctly different from the bald editorial cartooning that also appeared in The Masses. Their paintings were yet further removed from the editorial tone of the magazine. JOHN SLOAN, for instance, who occasionally contributed scathing editorial cartoons to The Masses, did not express any sense of social criticism in his paintings, which portray the energy and simple pleasures of the poor.  One cannot find in Cliff Dwellers, any trace of a change in tone from Bellowsâ€™s other urban scenes, whose subject and spirit center on the excitement and bustling activity of the city and the surging vitality of its lower classes. The spirit of the scene is established by the innocent joie de vivre of the brightly lighted foreground group of young women and children, especially the bawling, grinning, brawling boys so familiar in Bellowsâ€™s works. Another prominent note is the mother ascending the stairs on the far right, so reminiscent of the hard-working homemakers of Daumier and Chardin. On the far left, the bright colors of a market cart attract the eye. Except for the large building in deep shadow, the effect is that of sunshine, with a stiff breeze lifting some of the laundry. The irregular angles of the streets and the streetcarâ€™s Vesey Street destination sign suggest that this is a location in the Lower East Side of Manhattan between the Bowery and Catherine Slip below Chatam Square.  Bellowsâ€™s record book indicates that the painting was completed in May 1913. He wrote the title originally as The Cliff Dwellers but then crossed out the definite article. As noted in his record book during April 1913, Bellows completed three drawings for The Masses, including the museumâ€™s drawing reproduced in the August 1913 issue. Its title was recorded as Why donâ€™t they go to the Country for a Vacation? but is also identified, in parentheses, as (study for) Cliff Dwellers. The fact that the drawing reproduced in The Masses was completed at a time when Bellows very well may have been working on Cliff Dwellers raises the question of whether that drawing may originally have been made in preparation for the painting and then given a second life as a frontispiece in the magazine. On the other hand, the drawing is a transfer lithograph reworked with pen and ink, an uncharacteristic working method for Bellows, but one that he used for other Masses illustrations, which suggests that the drawing was done especially for the magazine.  The record book reveals that Cliff Dwellers was organized according to a disciplined color scheme, primarily based on the ideas of the color theorist and paint supplier Hardesty G. Maratta (1864-1924), which were of much interest to Bellows, Robert Henri, and others in the 1910s. The paintingâ€™s palette is indicated as: Three c[h]ords.  Orange -- Red-purple -- Green -blue. Blue-purple -- Green -- Red-orange Yellow-green -- Red -- Blue [colors indicated by initials in original]  Chords were a concept of Marattaâ€™s, triads of usually complementary colors that were chosen, like notes of the musical scale, to establish a particular harmony and mood for a painting. These chords of colors appear to work in different sections of Cliff Dwellers. In the produce wagon the first chord of orange, red-purple, and green-blue can be found, and these colors recur throughout the lower section of the painting in the crowd. Even the notes of yellow and blue there probably were created by mixing a good deal of white with the orange and the blue-green of the chord. The blue-purple of the second chord can be said to dominate the shadowed building at the left, with its green shutters and red brick wall. The wall, however, has too much blue in it to be called a red-orange. The yellow-green of the third chord is prominent in the lighted building at the right, although its patches of red and blue both tend toward purple. The chords are similar enough to blend easily into a unified painting with areas of relative emphasis on one chord or another. Bellowsâ€™s remarkable skill at mixing together different colors on the canvas, as he painted wet-into-wet, also enriched Cliff Dwellers with a multitude of intermediate hues that soften the discipline of what was to have been a limited palette while at the same time contributing to the quality of unity.  Along with Marattaâ€™s system of colors, Henri, Bellows, and other students of Henriâ€™s spent long hours studying and elaborating Marattaâ€™s approach to composition, which sought a similar harmony and balance, using a structure of simple geometrical forms. Bellowsâ€™s fascination with geometrical compositions after about 1917 is well known, but technical aspects of Cliff Dwellers suggest that his efforts in that direction had begun by at least 1913. Bellows appears to have inserted at least ninety pins into the canvas at regular intervals, making horizontal, vertical, and diagonal rows. He apparently painted around them and then pulled them out while the paint was still soft, leaving very small craters, some of which he painted over. In a few areas, where the paint is thinner, portions of diagonal lines in red paint can be seen. These coincide with diagonal rows of pinholes and may have been used either at an earlier stage of the painting or to establish the rows. The intervals between the rows were established so that the pinholes form equilateral triangles, the key concept of the Maratta system. Some of these relate closely to elements of the composition. For instance, the figure of a woman with a fan in the lower right corner has a pinhole at the top of her head and at the point of each elbow. Other features, such as the strong edge of the silhouetted building to the right of center, are aligned with rows of pinholes. Of course, numerous geometrical forms can be constructed from a web of pinholes like this one. Further study of geometry in Bellowsâ€™s earlier paintings will be necessary to establish which regular forms he used and how they contributed to his compositional objectives. Another question is posed by the numerous, apparently random pinholes in the museumâ€™s related drawing. Were they somehow used to transfer elements of the design, while aligning them with the structure of the painting?  The painting was well received, winning five hundred dollars and the third-prize medal in the annual exhibition of 1914 at the Carnegie Institute of Art, Pittsburgh. It toured the country and was shown in Los Angeles several times, in group and solo Bellows exhibitions, before its purchase by the museum on September 16, 1916. Although it was not included in the catalogue of the museumâ€™s exhibition of contemporary American paintings in the summer of 1916, the American Art News states that it was bought out of that exhibition.', ''),

Collector William Preston Harrison may have decided to buy one of Krollâ€™s New York scenes after seeing several exhibited in annuals of the Art Institute of Chicago. Kroll painted at least four canvases of the Forty-second Street and Broadway area, three of them in 1916. While two include a bit of Bryant Park, in this version Kroll omitted the park and any glimpse of nature. He focused on the skyscrapers that were then drastically changing the skyline of New York. As in most of his urban scenes, Kroll captured the energy and congestion of the metropolis by depicting the streets crowded with trolleys and pedestrians. New York was not a dark, dingy place to Kroll. This painting is in a high-keyed blue palette. Although not documented as being an enthusiastic disciple of Hardesty Marattaâ€™s color theory, as was his close friend GEORGE BELLOWS, Kroll may have been stimulated to use such an intense hue by the general interest in color then prevalent among artists. The cool hue suggests the cold of winter, and Kroll is known to have painted many Manhattan snow scenes. The artist would go to any extreme, painting outdoors or even hanging from windows, to capture a sense of the city. The intense palette was equaled by the bold brushwork that characterizes most of Krollâ€™s New York paintings.', ''),

Although the museumâ€™s painting of the same title has been often mistaken for the painting shown in the 1896 Salon, it is a similar, but later version. In both paintings Tanner delineated an Old Testament story set during the reign of King Darius in ancient Persia (Dan. 6:16-24). Tanner infused the drama of Danielâ€™s unjust imprisonment with a quiet spirituality. The earlier canvas was Tannerâ€™s first major religious painting and indicated the direction that his art would take. The choice of a religious subject may have been inspired initially by his teacher Laurens, who was noted for dramatic biblical paintings. Tannerâ€™s depiction of a dark prison cell, dramatically lit by evening light streaming through a high window, may have also come from Laurens, whose Le Grand Inquisiteur chez les rois catholiques, 1886 (Philadelphia Museum of Art) -- a painting also about an unjust imprisonment -- is similar in composition and lighting. It is probably not coincidental that Tanner owned a reproduction of the Laurens painting and kept it throughout his career (it is among the Tanner Papers). The decision to select a narrative in which animals play a major role may have been determined by Tannerâ€™s previous success with animal paintings; he had sold Lions at Home, by 1885 (unlocated), when it was exhibited in 1885 at the National Academy of Design. When he decided to paint this subject he prepared himself by sketching the lions at the Jardins des Plants and by studying with the noted animalier Emmanuel FrÃ©miet.  Tanner often painted variations on the same theme. The museumâ€™s version was probably executed in the years before the First World War, possibly as early as 1907. Tanner exhibited a painting entitled Daniel in the Lionsâ€™ Den at the annual of the Pennsylvania Academy in 1896-97, at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of 1904 in Saint Louis, his 1908 show at the American Art Galleries in New York, and the Anglo-American Exposition in London in 1914. It was probably the second version that was exhibited in the last two, however, none of the descriptions in the reviews of any of these exhibitions is specific enough for determining which version was shown. Although the museumâ€™s painting is on paper, it probably was not intended as a sketch but as an independent, second version. (In 1976 the canvas used to back the museumâ€™s painting was found to have on it an unfinished oil possibly illustrating a scene from the life of Job and able to be dated on stylistic grounds to the late 1890s or early years of the 1900s.)  The museumâ€™s painting is a recapitulation of the scene as Tanner depicted it in his 1896 Salon painting, but he changed the format and modified details. The earlier Daniel in the Lionsâ€™ Den was a vertical painting in which half the composition was taken up by the shadowy, high-ceilinged structure above the head of Daniel. In the second version, Tanner eliminated the ceiling to focus more on the figure. Both paintings emphasized shadows, with a brilliant light illuminating the lower half of Danielâ€™s figure, especially his bound hands. While the shape and size of the illuminated area were altered in the second version -- to show more of the prisonerâ€™s figure -- the change was not significant. The first version included an elaborate Assyrian frieze. Although such details were in keeping with the late nineteenth-century academic taste for archaeological accuracy and narration, they did not accord with Tannerâ€™s mature painting style.  During the first decade of this century Tanner developed a poetic style in which he used color and light to evoke the essence of a religious story. In the museumâ€™s painting Daniel appears calm, strengthened by his inner spiritual belief, and Tannerâ€™s use of a bluegreen palette heightened this meditative mood. Experiments with pigments and glazing begun around 1907 enabled him to infuse his art with a soft, glowing light and shimmering color. While the overall color scheme of Daniel in the Lionsâ€™ Den is tonal -- typical of Tannerâ€™s mature canvases -- the painting actually is much more varied in color than it initially appears, for the lions are sketched in brilliant shades of yellow, green, and lavender.', ''),

The setting has recently been identified as Almyâ€™s Pond, near Newport, Rhode Island. This low-lying area of the Rhode Island coast, with its rolling hills and salt marshes, was a popular site with American artists at mid-century and was painted by Martin Johnson Heade (1819-1904) and William Trost Richards (1833-1905) as well as Kensett. The numerous landscapes of the Newport vicinity listed in the sales catalogue of his estate indicate that Kensett often worked in the area. The museumâ€™s painting may be one of the three Almyâ€™s Pond scenes of similar size sold at auction in 1873 (New York, Association Hall, The Collection of Over Five Hundred Paintings and Studies by the Late John E. Kensett, nos. 366, 454, 559; another painting of the same subject and similar size believed to be one of these three is in the Terra Museum of American Art, Chicago). A very similar landscape painted around 1860 from the same vantage point that recently appeared on the art market (see Related Work) suggests that the museumâ€™s canvas was painted about the same time.  In the museumâ€™s painting Kensett viewed the pond, which once was an inlet of the Rhode Island Sound, looking toward the nearby sound, indicated by the large sailboats in the distance. The topography well suited Kensettâ€™s temperament for serene, open landscapes. The museumâ€™s painting typifies the artistâ€™s mature luminist images of the 1860s. It is a tranquil view of nature on a sunny day with a clear, almost cloudless sky dominating the horizontal composition. Little activity occurs. The cattle grazing do not disturb the harmony of the composition, allowing the viewer to attain a transcendental unity with nature; even Kensettâ€™s thin, smooth brushwork keeps from intruding upon the illusion of contact with nature.', ''),

The liberties that Hill took with topography make it difficult to identify conclusively the sites of a number of his paintings, but the distinctive double-peaked hill at the left, known as Maggies Peaks, mark this painting as a view of Lake Tahoe, and the waterfall suggests Emerald Bay. The Daily Alta California of June 19, 1864, in the year the museumâ€™s landscape was painted, mentioned that Hill exhibited a view of Emerald Bay of about the same size and also showing Maggies Peaks and the same sunset effect: â€˜A beautiful bit of Emerald Bay, Lake Tahoe by T.

The artist is so much identified with California views it is easy to forget that he came west as an accomplished landscape painter who had sketched in the White Mountains of New Hampshire with Benjamin Champney (1817-1907), Asher B.

Their principal objective was to capture the beauty of Yosemite Valley, which the photographs of Carleton Watkins (1829-1916) had revealed to astonished New Yorkers in 1862. In a drawing room in San Francisco in August, on the eve of their departure for the final leg of their journey there, they again gazed at Watkinsâ€™s photographs. Shortly before reaching Yosemite, they and other artist-companions -- Enoch Wood Perry (1831-1915) and Virgil Williams (1830-1886) of San Francisco -- paused near Mariposa to sketch the big trees. Although the museumâ€™s painting was not executed until about ten years later, it should not be surprising that in it Bierstadt borrowed the subject and vantage point of one of Watkinsâ€™s early photographs of the Grizzly Giant Sequoia. The size of the museumâ€™s painting indicates that it was not one of the oil sketches Bierstadt made that day. All of his sketches from that trip were fourteen by nineteen inches or smaller. Bierstadt did not employ the twenty-two-by-thirty-inch sheet until 1872, and then only for oil sketches painted in the studio. The museumâ€™s painting probably dates from Bierstadtâ€™s residence in San Francisco (1871-73). It may be visible in a photograph probably taken in 1873 of the artistâ€™s studio, where it hangs on the wall among rows of studio sketches (Hendricks, Bierstadt, CL-6). Bierstadt often painted the big California trees. He exhibited such paintings in 1874 at the National Academy of Design and the Royal Academy. The Grizzly Giant still stands in Mariposa Grove. The huge tree, to the left of center in the painting, was 28 feet wide and 209 feet high. Equally impressive was the giantâ€™s age, estimated at twenty-five hundred years, a span of time going back to the kings of the Old Testament. Bierstadt may have used the museumâ€™s painting as a study for his ten-foot-high California Redwoods, painted in about 1875 (private collection). In that painting he corrected the Grizzly Giantâ€™s leaning, noticeable in the oil study. Intended as a record for the artistâ€™s later use, these studies have a fresh realism often sacrificed to dramatic effect in the finished exhibition paintings.', ''),

Cresmer (56.2)', 'Rustic farm life not only furnished financial support for Fuller during the 1860s but also served as the main inspiration for his late landscapes. Even more than Millet and the other Barbizon painters he admired, Fuller viewed farm life in idyllic terms. His pastorals often consist of a small figure standing to the extreme side of a broad, open field. Girl with Turkeys is similar to Turkey Pasture in Kentucky, 1878 (Chrysler Museum, Norfolk, Va.) in which a single female stands to the left in the foreground near the flock of turkeys she is tending. During the last several years of his life Fuller created a number of such farm scenes, which reveal his rural New England heritage. As with all his pastorals, the activity depicted is of minor importance, for the open field with its light and air provide the vehicle for the artist to express the harmony of an idyllic rustic life.  Fuller painted the entire scene in his typical earthy, but nuanced palette of muted brown, beige, ocher, and khaki green. His handling of the paint was equally suggestive; the strokes, often applied one layer over another, and the scribbled effect of his brush handle drawn over the wet paint in the foliage suggest the activity of the trees, but the rest of the scene is enveloped in a delicate haze as the soft strokes of the atmosphere blur all outlines. Like other advanced artists of the period, Fuller was as much interested in paint manipulation as in representation.  Contemporary critics recognized Fullerâ€™s poetic nature and his place in American culture. When this painting was exhibited at Doll and Richards an unidentified reviewer astutely noted:  It is with the work of Fuller as it is with the work of Ralph Waldo Emerson. It matters little what one reads of Emerson ... its influence is an indefinite exhilaration-or, rather, inspiration; the definite things he says are secondary in their value. So it is with Fuller. His pictures are impossible as nature but beyond value as dignifying and ennobling impulses. In the present instance the vague, phantasmal girl and her wandering turkeys, the shadowy hut close under the thick deep forest, the hazy shapes of trees ... and the dull yellow sky, while none of them could be considered possible in the smallest degree, are yet details of a whole which is singularly impressive.  In the Fuller memorial volume Girl with Turkeys was dated to the artistâ€™s last year. The painting has a label from A. A. Walker of 594 Washington Street, who was a colorman located at such an address in Boston from 1877 to 1880. When it was sold at auction less than thirty years after its creation, the painting received a record price for a Fuller painting and the second highest price ever brought by a contemporary American picture at auction.', ''),

He preferred instead to base his color abstractions on the figure. He and Morgan Russell both greatly admired the muscular figures of Michelangelo (1475-1564) and used his powerful human forms in their paintings. Synchromy in Purple is one of many paintings in which the artist based the composition on a heroic figure. In Synchromy in Blue, 1916 (Weyhe Gallery, New York, as of 1978), the figure is presented in almost the same seated pose, its large, muscular body nearly bursting beyond the edges of the canvas. Synchromy in Purple is typical of the color abstractions Macdonald-Wright painted around 1916 and 1917. The artist purged his palette of blended tertiary colors, relying largely on the primary and secondary hues of the color spectrum-in this case using reds, blues, purples, and yellows-and often presenting them as complementary color chords. While Russellâ€™s palette had been limited to these colors as early as 1913, Macdonald-Wright did not adopt such prismatic hues until later. Unlike Russell, Macdonald-Wright employed white extensively, thereby creating paintings with a softer, more crystalline luminosity. Moreover, he did not present the colors as fractured colored planes; here he sketched in the basic contours and even some of the details of the face with arcing blue lines and applied the brilliant hues in long strokes. The white and color passages function together to suggest light and dark and consequently a modeled human body. Despite Macdonald-Wrightâ€™s intentions, the color becomes almost a decorative overlay, and consequently the later synchromies such as this example appear less avant-garde. Macdonald-Wrightâ€™s paintings would always retain a certain luminous delicacy, and these qualities accorded well with his later fascination with oriental philosophy and art.', ''),

Actually the landscapes fit well into his oeuvre, since nearly all of Binghamâ€™s narrative scenes were set out-of-doors, in locales often similar to those of his landscapes. Based on formal criteria, most of Binghamâ€™s landscapes are dated from the late 1840s and early 1850s. A View of a Lake in the Mountains has traditionally been considered a work from the years prior to Binghamâ€™s study in DÃ¼sseldorf, dating either c. 1851 or 1853-56. While A View of a Lake has motifs similar to those in Landscape with Fisherman, c. 1850 (Missouri Historical Society, Saint Louis)--the tiny figure of the fisherman and the rocky setting near a body of water--it is a much more complex and formal landscape.  One authority has suggested that Bingham painted A View of a Lake in the mountains while in Germany; he is known to have done landscapes for his own satisfaction when in DÃ¼sseldorf. The landscape displays the sophisticated approach to form and space of the DÃ¼sseldorf school. Unlike his earlier landscapes in which numerous passages are amorphous and ill defined, the rocks and foliage in the foreground of A View of a Lake are sharply delineated with a crisp drawing technique and clear light. The sunlight on the right forms a pattern of alternating passages of light and shadow, a characteristic typical of Binghamâ€™s German-period figure paintings. The rocks and trees in the foreground of the landscapes of the early 1850s frame the scene, while the rocks in this mountain view are placed one behind the other to define spatial recession. In the one known landscape datable to his DÃ¼sseldorf period, Moonlight Scene: Castle on the Rhine, c. 1857-59 (private collection), Bingham adopted a hard finish and massed lights and darks in a similar manner to emphasize a progression of planes rather than a continuous recession as in his earlier landscapes. The distant rock formations appear more idealized and their stylized shapes are described by a softer, almost opalescent palette. They have been compared with Alpine scenery. Thus, the increased sophistication Bingham demonstrated in this landscape compared with those from the early 1850s suggests that the painting dates from his years in DÃ¼sseldorf or from the period immediately following his European visit.', ''),

Mendelson (M.66.66.2)', 'When this landscape surfaced in the 1940s it bore the title The Mohawk Valley because it resembled a landscape by that name in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Newly found documentary evidence has led to the identification of the Metropolitan Museumâ€™s landscape as a painting titled Tennessee. Although contemporary references do not mention that Wyant was active in Tennessee, he may have visited the state when he was sketching in neighboring Kentucky during the late 1850s and early 1860s. In 1865 the artist traveled to DÃ¼sseldorf, and it was there in 1866 that he painted the Metropolitanâ€™s painting.  The Los Angeles Museumâ€™s Landscape resembles the Metropolitan Museumâ€™s Tennessee in Wyantâ€™s general approach to the mountainous landscape: taking an elevated perspective, the artist presented a broad view, delineating the meanderings of a river in the middle distance and placing to one side a single, tall tree that provides a point of entry for the viewer. Both paintings have a similar rocky ledge in the foreground on which the artist stood to view the scene, although in Tennessee the ledge is actually the escarpment of a river. Despite the similarities-many of which may have derived from traditional studio landscape devices there are enough differences to question whether the Los Angeles Museumâ€™s painting is of the same scene of the Grand Canyon of Tennessee in the Cumberland Mountains that has been identified as the site depicted in the Metropolitan Museumâ€™s painting. The distant mountains in Landscape do not have the same configuration as the mountains in Tennessee, in which the gorge between Signal and Lookout Mountains formed by the Tennessee River is delineated.  Although the date and size of Landscape suggest that Wyant may have intended it to be a study for Tennessee, there is no conclusive documentary evidence to prove such a link between the two paintings. Moreover, Landscape appears to be more complete in execution than a study might be.  Landscape is a highly finished, tightly painted work in which a brilliantly clear atmosphere and bright colors dominate. From its earliest days, Tennessee was criticized for its subdued colors and its style linked with the DÃ¼sseldorf school. Landscape, however, demonstrates that the crisp, linear quality of the Metropolitan Museumâ€™s painting of 1866 may not have been due solely to the influence of German art. In the Los Angeles painting of the preceding year, Wyant was meticulous in his delineation of the blades of grass and occasional flower. He even conveyed the striations of the foreground rock formations. Such an exacting representation was extolled by John Ruskin and enthusiastically followed by the English criticâ€™s American disciples in the late 1850s and early 1860s.  While DÃ¼sseldorf-trained artists shared with Ruskinâ€™s followers an interest in a heightened technical realism, they did not use a similar palette. English Pre-Raphaelite painters, whom Ruskin held up as exemplifying the best in art, were noted for their brilliant hues. The DÃ¼sseldorf painters were usually criticized for their cold, colorless palette. The museumâ€™s Landscape not only has a more varied and brighter palette than the somber browns and greens of the Metropolitan painting, more importantly it has the unique lavender-green combination found only in those mid-century American landscape paintings inspired by the English Pre-Raphaelites. Wyant briefly visited New York in 1857, the year of the first major showing of Pre-Raphaelite art in the United States, but it is more likely that he first came into contact with their art after his move to New York in 1863. Although it is not known exactly when in 1865 Wyant painted Landscape, most likely it was executed before his trip to Germany.  Due to the lack of early, dated Wyant landscapes, it is difficult to characterize the artistâ€™s development before his European studies. If the museumâ€™s Landscape is typical of the artistâ€™s style immediately prior to his European travels, then the differences between the 1865 landscape and the larger 1866 painting demonstrate the alteration in Wyantâ€™s approach that occurred as a result of his studies with Gude. The transformation of Wyantâ€™s palette was not the only change. In the museumâ€™s Landscape Wyant depicted a more natural, almost accidental view, the type that Ruskin extolled, but in Tennessee he adopted a traditional academic approach to landscape painting and presented a grand vista centered around a waterfall in the foreground. The other major difference between the two paintings is the overall mood the artist established through the meteorological conditions depicted. The sky in Landscape is clear and calm while that in Tennessee is stormy and overcast. Wyantâ€™s emphasis on clarity and factual detail in the 1865 painting suggests an emphasis on accurate transcription, and his veiling of Tennessee in clouds and shadows reveals that subsequently, in Germany, he adopted the highly romantic approach of the DÃ¼sseldorf school.', ''),

He entered the army in 1756 and was a lieutenant when the Seventy-seventh Regiment, or Montgomerieâ€™s Highlanders, was raised and commissioned by his kinsman Archibald Montgomerie (later eleventh earl of Eglinton). The regiment saw action in the French and Indian War at Fort Duquesne, Ticonderoga, and other places and in 1760 and 1761 against the Cherokees, defeating them in battles at Etchocy and War-Womenâ€™s Creek. Hugh Montgomerie had risen to the rank of major by 1780, when Copley painted his portrait, and had been elected member of Parliament for Ayrshire. He succeeded to the title of twelfth earl of Eglinton in 1796.  In 1780 Montgomerieâ€™s bright political career yet lay before him. He was still active in the army, rising to the rank of colonel in 1793, so it would have been natural for him to have himself portrayed as a soldier. The decision to paint him leading a battle fought twenty years earlier probably was the artistâ€™s. The portrait belongs to the tradition of grand-manner portraiture, as promulgated by Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792), president of the Royal Academy. The concept was to raise the artistic value of a portrait by ennobling mere representation with elements of higher art. Copleyâ€™s portrait meets these objectives by incorporating elements of history painting, considered to be the highest genre. It has a color and drama not to be found in simple portraiture, depicting the subject as a man of energy and importance. Another elevating feature, which serves to further flatter the subject, results from Copleyâ€™s decision to follow Reynoldsâ€™s example by posing Montgomerie in the striding stance of the Apollo Belvedere (Vatican Museum, Rome), then considered the greatest ancient sculpture.  Comparison with the museumâ€™s Portrait of a Lady shows how quickly after his arrival in England Copley had mastered the heightened palette and bravura technique of the best of the English school.', ''),

Girl with Cows relates closely to the peasant images Hunt created while in France, in particular his On the Edge of the Forest, c. 1853 (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), in which a woman stands next to a grazing cow in a forest glade. The image of a female peasant quietly involved in knitting or sewing, while tending farm animals, was a common theme in mid-century French art. Millet created several such images, including Peasant Woman Guarding Her Cow, 1852 (Museum Boymans-van Beuningen, Rotterdam), while Hunt lived at Barbizon.  Edward Wheelwright, another follower of Millet in the intimate circle around Hunt, may have been instrumental in Huntâ€™s creating this specific image. Wheelwright brought back to America Milletâ€™s The Knitter, 1856 (Cincinnati Art Museum), which is the closest pictorial source for Huntâ€™s Girl with Cows. Unlike On the Edge of the Forest but similar to Milletâ€™s The Knitter, Girl with Cows depicts a young peasant girl in a secluded forest glade with the thick foliage of trees forming a barrier between her and the distant field seen partially in the distance. Consequently the focus is solely on the figure and cows.  The scene is painted in dark, shadowy tones. Two cows--one brown, the other white--frame the young girl, forming contrasts of light and dark, while picking up the sweet pink and blue colors of her simple peasant garb. The white handkerchief wrapped around her head glows in the reflected yellows and pinks. Indeed, the entire scene is rich with color, even to the warm browns and greens of the darker passages.', ''),

The painting recalls his English, period portrait of Lieutenant General Charles Otway, 1724 (Royal Sussex Regiment, Chichester) in its use of the convention of half armor for a military commander. The armor is at least a century earlier in its design, which presumably was taken from Smibertâ€™s treasury of drawings and engravings. The armor, a highly unusual feature in Boston portraiture, with its virtuoso highlights and reflections, was a showpiece of Smibertâ€™s abilities and could not fail to catch the eye of the poetizing Mather Byles, who mentioned it in the line, and studious Mascarene asserts his arms.  The portrait also contains a landscape background and a small still life of a map and drafting instruments. The still life refers to Mascareneâ€™s coastal survey of Nova Scotia, which could have served as the basis for the fortified harbor seen in the portrait. Smibert was one of the few early colonial artists who sometimes painted specific, actual landscapes as backgrounds in his portraits. Whether it depicts an actual or proposed fortification, it apparently is not Annapolis Royal, the location with which Mascarene is chiefly associated and for which he attempted to improve the fortifications.  Paul Mascarene was born Jean-Paul Mascarene in France in 1684 or 1685 of a family of Huguenots later forced to leave the country after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. He was educated in Geneva and in 1706 began a military career in England. In 1708 he was in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, preparing troops for an expedition against Canada, and in 1710 he was the captain who took possession of Port Royal (renamed Annapolis Royal) in the campaign that won Nova Scotia for Britain. He was thereafter very involved in the military life and civil government of the province, although he spent much time in Boston, where he married Elizabeth Perry, built a large brick house, and raised a family. He was known as a man of considerable learning and taste. In a letter of 1740 he referred to four large pictures of Mr. Smibert in his possession.

The collecting of oriental bric-a-brac became very popular in America among artists and the general public with the initiating of trade relations between Japan and the West by Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853 and with the exhibition of many exotic objects at the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia. Vedder was particularly fortunate as a collector; for his brother Alexander Madison Vedder was a physician practicing in Japan from 1865 to 1870, first privately and then as head of the Imperial Hospital at Kobe. Dr. Vedder was well aware of the beauty and exoticism of oriental items and purchased many objects. After Alexanderâ€™s death in 1870, Vedder received three trunks containing his brotherâ€™s effects, including his Japanese purchases. The objects in Vedderâ€™s Japanese still-life paintings may have been among them. This painting depicts nineteenth-century items: the golden heron screen in the style of the Kano school, a shiny, black Meijiperiod vase, an album of paintings with a bonsai on the left page, and a carpet probably of Japanese manufacture but with a Western-influenced design. Despite his awareness of the nature of Japanese aesthetics, and unlike his friend Charles Caryl Coleman, who used the Japanese aesthetic in his still lifes of this period, Vedder conceived his painting in traditional Western terms. The arrangement resembles the way in which Japanese items were displayed at the 1876 Centennial and pictured in various books commemorating the fair. The manner in which Vedder luxuriated in the voluminous folds of the rich drapery reveals his long-standing love of elegant textiles, seen more often in his single-figure paintings of the 1870s. During his lifetime Vedder exhibited still lifes that included oriental objects and were sometimes titled Japanese Still Life. It is possible that the museumâ€™s example was the one exhibited in Vedderâ€™s showings of 1880. However, since the painting was privately owned by then, it is unlikely that the museumâ€™s painting was the still life included in Vedderâ€™s 1900-1901 traveling exhibition or his exhibitions in New York and Boston in 1912.', ''),

Connell Foundation (M.74.53)', 'Although Cole made his early reputation with his romantic interpretations of the American wilderness, his chief interest was in ideal landscapes rather than realistic depictions of specific locations. He painted his first pair of ideal compositions, The Garden of Eden, 1828 (unlocated), and Expulsion from the Garden of Eden, 1828 (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), even before his first trip to Europe in 1829, by which time he already had compiled a long list of ideal subjects; among them the paired titles Lâ€™Allegro and Il Penseroso. Paired and serial paintings were to occupy much of his interest and best efforts over the following years.  A commission from the collector Charles M. Parker permitted Cole to undertake the paintings Lâ€™Allegro and Il Penseroso. On January 8, 1844, Cole wrote to Parker: I intend to commence two pictures, to be called Lâ€™Allegro and Il Penseroso. In the first picture, I should represent a sunny luxuriant landscape, with figures engaged variously in gay pastimes or pleasant occupation. In the second picture, I would represent some ivy clad ruin in the solemn evening twilight, with a solitary figure musing among the decaying grandeur .... The subject ... is one upon which I can work conamore. The paintings are dated 1845 and were exhibited at the annual exhibition of the National Academy of Design in the spring of 1846, but with the titles Italian Sunset and View of Lago de Nemi, near Rome.  Il Penseroso is based fairly closely upon a detailed view of Lake Nemi with the town of Nemi that Cole had drawn in 1832. He drew the shrine on the notebookâ€™s facing page, as a repositioned foreground element of the landscape, and transferred its design to the painting with the same degree of fidelity, leading one to conclude that the shrine was an actual structure, possibly at that location. The trees behind the shrine and figure before it are the only major elements not present in the drawing.  In contrast to Il Penserosoâ€™s specific and realistic portrayal, Lâ€™Allegro seems to be a completely ideal and imaginary landscape. The conventionally picturesque composition resembles a sketch now apparently misidentified as a study for the 1838 painting A Dream of Arcadia. To this framework Cole introduced various architectural elements. The art historian Wayne Craven has pointed out the resemblance of the Doric colonnade in the left distance to the early Greek temples in Italy that Cole had traveled to see and paint in 1832 and 1842. The other ruins are more difficult to identify specifically. The right foreground arches, which resume on the other side of the river, could be the remains of a Roman bridge, but they also recall the Claudian aqueduct painted by Cole on several occasions. The brickwork, however, is unlike that in Coleâ€™s other depictions of the monument. The softness of Coleâ€™s rendering of the circular temple on the extreme right suggests that he did not intend to depict any specific ruin. The hilltop town near the center of the painting likewise has a generalized, ideal quality, unlike the detailed accuracy of Coleâ€™s rendering of the town of Nemi in Il Penseroso. Whereas Il Penseroso is an actual view, Lâ€™Allegro belongs to the tradition of ideal arcadian landscapes composed by Cole and many others of his generation and earlier.  The titles Il Penseroso and Lâ€™Allegro refer to a pair of poems by John Milton, one characterizing a cheerful and the other a melancholy outlook. Coleâ€™s landscapes contain none of the setting and specific detail of the poems (except, in a general sense, for the dance in Lâ€™Allegro), but they do present contrasting moods. Rather than illustrating the poems, the paintings translate their overall meaning into the visual language of landscape. The pair represents approximately the same time of day, late afternoon, but the degree of brightness and relative warmth of the light differ because of the terrain. The horizon of Lâ€™Allegro is low, the foreground water reflecting even more of the generous expanse of sky. The distance of the one large hill contributes to the feeling of openness and light. The scene is bathed in the warm Claudian light of contentment. In a landscape filled with references to antiquity, the foreground dancer, his pose modeled after the Dancing Faun from the House of the Faun in Pompeii (Museo Nazionale, Naples), suggests the survival of a pagan strain among the peasants of the day, as had Donatello in Hawthorneâ€™s The Marble Faun. Lâ€™Allegro evokes the innocent joyfulness of the arcadian ideal.  In contrast, the encircling walls of Lake Nemiâ€™s crater in Il Penseroso shut out both light and sky, their shaggy slopes looming ominously. The painting is both darker and cooler than Lâ€™Allegro. The rough foreground foliage and forested background seem more agitated than the broad expanse of smoothness of Lâ€™Allegro. Although the foreground of Il Penseroso is near the Grove of Diana, off to the left, and the site recalls the pagan past (with some of its most somber associations), the painting is dominated by associations with Italyâ€™s Christian piety: a shrine to the Virgin built upon the medieval fortifications of Nemi. In contrast to the merry peasants of Lâ€™Allegro, the foreground figure kneels with an abjectness suggesting grief.  The pair of paintings expresses the sense of Miltonâ€™s poems in terms of highly sophisticated concepts-in the opposition of the conventions of picturesque and sublime landscape and in terms of Italian architectural and intellectual history. As embodied in these paintings, Coleâ€™s concept of ideal landscape is so rich with intellectual and poetic content that the two form a complex unit, depending upon each other for their complete meaning.', ''),

The mood is that of an airless stillness and solitude, a visionary landscape of the spirit rather than of a particular place and time. More than many, which have greatly darkened over time, this evocative painting reveals Blakelockâ€™s sensitivity to delicate color, which is employed with an almost musical sense of abstract design.', ''),

He painted his first pair of ideal compositions, The Garden of Eden, 1828 (unlocated), and Expulsion from the Garden of Eden, 1828 (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), even before his first trip to Europe in 1829, by which time he already had compiled a long list of ideal subjects; among them the paired titles Lâ€™Allegro and Il Penseroso. Paired and serial paintings were to occupy much of his interest and best efforts over the following years.  A commission from the collector Charles M. Parker permitted Cole to undertake the paintings Lâ€™Allegro and Il Penseroso. On January 8, 1844, Cole wrote to Parker: I intend to commence two pictures, to be called Lâ€™Allegro and Il Penseroso. In the first picture, I should represent a sunny luxuriant landscape, with figures engaged variously in gay pastimes or pleasant occupation. In the second picture, I would represent some ivy clad ruin in the solemn evening twilight, with a solitary figure musing among the decaying grandeur .... The subject ... is one upon which I can work conamore. The paintings are dated 1845 and were exhibited at the annual exhibition of the National Academy of Design in the spring of 1846, but with the titles Italian Sunset and View of Lago de Nemi, near Rome.  Il Penseroso is based fairly closely upon a detailed view of Lake Nemi with the town of Nemi that Cole had drawn in 1832. He drew the shrine on the notebookâ€™s facing page, as a repositioned foreground element of the landscape, and transferred its design to the painting with the same degree of fidelity, leading one to conclude that the shrine was an actual structure, possibly at that location. The trees behind the shrine and figure before it are the only major elements not present in the drawing.  In contrast to Il Penserosoâ€™s specific and realistic portrayal, Lâ€™Allegro seems to be a completely ideal and imaginary landscape. The conventionally picturesque composition resembles a sketch now apparently misidentified as a study for the 1838 painting A Dream of Arcadia. To this framework Cole introduced various architectural elements. The art historian Wayne Craven has pointed out the resemblance of the Doric colonnade in the left distance to the early Greek temples in Italy that Cole had traveled to see and paint in 1832 and 1842. The other ruins are more difficult to identify specifically. The right foreground arches, which resume on the other side of the river, could be the remains of a Roman bridge, but they also recall the Claudian aqueduct painted by Cole on several occasions. The brickwork, however, is unlike that in Coleâ€™s other depictions of the monument. The softness of Coleâ€™s rendering of the circular temple on the extreme right suggests that he did not intend to depict any specific ruin. The hilltop town near the center of the painting likewise has a generalized, ideal quality, unlike the detailed accuracy of Coleâ€™s rendering of the town of Nemi in Il Penseroso. Whereas Il Penseroso is an actual view, Lâ€™Allegro belongs to the tradition of ideal arcadian landscapes composed by Cole and many others of his generation and earlier.  The titles Il Penseroso and Lâ€™Allegro refer to a pair of poems by John Milton, one characterizing a cheerful and the other a melancholy outlook. Coleâ€™s landscapes contain none of the setting and specific detail of the poems (except, in a general sense, for the dance in Lâ€™Allegro), but they do present contrasting moods. Rather than illustrating the poems, the paintings translate their overall meaning into the visual language of landscape. The pair represents approximately the same time of day, late afternoon, but the degree of brightness and relative warmth of the light differ because of the terrain. The horizon of Lâ€™Allegro is low, the foreground water reflecting even more of the generous expanse of sky. The distance of the one large hill contributes to the feeling of openness and light. The scene is bathed in the warm Claudian light of contentment. In a landscape filled with references to antiquity, the foreground dancer, his pose modeled after the Dancing Faun from the House of the Faun in Pompeii (Museo Nazionale, Naples), suggests the survival of a pagan strain among the peasants of the day, as had Donatello in Hawthorneâ€™s The Marble Faun. Lâ€™Allegro evokes the innocent joyfulness of the arcadian ideal.  In contrast, the encircling walls of Lake Nemiâ€™s crater in Il Penseroso shut out both light and sky, their shaggy slopes looming ominously. The painting is both darker and cooler than Lâ€™Allegro. The rough foreground foliage and forested background seem more agitated than the broad expanse of smoothness of Lâ€™Allegro. Although the foreground of Il Penseroso is near the Grove of Diana, off to the left, and the site recalls the pagan past (with some of its most somber associations), the painting is dominated by associations with Italyâ€™s Christian piety: a shrine to the Virgin built upon the medieval fortifications of Nemi. In contrast to the merry peasants of Lâ€™Allegro, the foreground figure kneels with an abjectness suggesting grief.  The pair of paintings expresses the sense of Miltonâ€™s poems in terms of highly sophisticated concepts-in the opposition of the conventions of picturesque and sublime landscape and in terms of Italian architectural and intellectual history. As embodied in these paintings, Coleâ€™s concept of ideal landscape is so rich with intellectual and poetic content that the two form a complex unit, depending upon each other for their complete meaning.', ''),

In a manuscript list of some of his works Weir indicated that An Artistâ€™s Studio was painted in 1863 and 1864.  He intended to exhibit the picture for the first time in the spring exhibition of the National Academy of Design in 1864, but the artist SANFORD R. GIFFORD, a friend and neighbor in the Tenth Street Studio Building, admired it enough to borrow it first for an exhibition and reception at the Athenaeum Club. Its favorable reception at the exhibition of the National Academy of Design was Weirâ€™s first great success, causing his election as an associate member of the academy. Even though he raised the price, Weir sold it soon afterward.  Robert Weir had introduced his son to the world of art and to numerous leading artists, so it seems appropriate that a painting of the distinguished artist in his studio at West Point should have been John Ferguson Weirâ€™s introduction to the National Academy of Design and the art world of New York. The young Weir had served what he considered an apprenticeship in that studio and wrote of it in the same manuscript draft of the Recollections: Brought up in an artistâ€™s studio, surrounded with what was actively related to the practice of art, with opportunity for gaining such knowledge of the past as the collections and library of the house inspired, it only needed a strong incentive to get from this what was requisite in the way of preparations in following oneâ€™s bent. At any rate, the results of this experience supplied my equipment when eventually I struck out in the swim and found myself in the Tenth Street Studios. The significance the subject had for the young Weir is reflected in the fact that he painted the studio in other works, The Artistâ€™s Studio, 1864 (Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Connecticut), The Studio, 1864 (art market 1976), and The Morning Paper, 1868 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). What apparently is a study for the right side of the museumâ€™s painting is preserved in the West Point Museum. An inventory made in 1914 indicates that he still had at that time two paintings and oil sketches of the interior of a studio, as well as two photographs thought to be of the interior of his fatherâ€™s studio (New Haven, Yale University, John Ferguson Weir Papers, Professor Weirâ€™s Portfolio, Case in Lobby to Store-room, March 1914, pp. 4, 5). An Artistâ€™s Studio depicts Robert Weir writing in his studio, surrounded by his own paintings, drawings, and artistâ€™s equipment, as well as antique furniture, armor, and other artifacts assembled by him, for he was conscientious about the accuracy of the details of his history paintings. The very size of the studio, a space of two stories open to the roof, recalled his most famous history painting in that the studio was an addition to his original stone quarters that was built to enable him to paint The Embarkation of the Pilgrims, 1843, for the rotunda of the Capitol in Washington. Two studies for that painting can be seen on the left side of the back wall, the upper one a study for the figure of John Robinson, the pastor, and the lower one a study for those of Miles Standish and his wife. His most recent success, Taking the Veil, 1863 (Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven), is represented as on the large easel in the center of the room. It had been a critical triumph when exhibited in February 1863 in Goupilâ€™s gallery in New York and later, by April of that year, in his sonâ€™s Tenth Street studio. The other recognizable images depicted are also ones that had special meaning for Robert Weir: the version of his celebrated painting Saint Nicholas of 1837 (unlocated; one of numerous replicas or later versions, dated 1838, New-York Historical Society) that can be seen near the upper right-hand corner of The Artistâ€™s Studio, and the large bust near it, on top of the cabinet, a replica of a bust of 1840 by Shobal Vail Clevenger (1812-1843) of Washington Allston (1779-1843), esteemed as the greatest American artist of the romantic period. Propped up on the cabinet is an oil sketch of what looks like a Deposition, perhaps a study for the painting, Evening of the Crucifixion, which Robert Weir exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1864 (unlocated). The cabinet had been used as a background in the artistâ€™s painting, The Microscope, 1849 (Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven).  Although surrounded by evidence of his artistic activity and success, Robert Weir is shown writing at his book-lined desk rather than painting. Father and son shared the ideal of the artist as a man of wide reading and a resultingly deep knowledge and rich imagination. An artist of the romantic period thought of himself as a poet, rather than primarily a craftsman, his chief effort being conceptual.  Although the paintingâ€™s dramatic shadows suggest this lofty realm of the imagination, An Artistâ€™s Studio was developed in terms of clear spatial progression and firm drawing. Henry T. Tuckerman in 1867 praised Robert Weirâ€™s Taking the Veil for its architectural truth and correct drawing (Tuckerman 1867, p. 214), but these qualities were developed much further in his sonâ€™s An Artistâ€™s Studio. Robert Weirâ€™s instruction to the cadets in military draftsmanship must have emphasized perspective drawing and clear rendering of details. The son he trained was exceptionally strong in both these areas. At the same time, the paintingâ€™s highly detailed quality reflects the taste of the 1860s, as seen in the work of his neighbors in the Tenth Street Studio Building.  The entry for the painting in the catalogue of the National Academy of Designâ€™s exhibition included the following poem:  ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ I well remember how the light, the pale, pure north light, fell ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€  ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ On all within that lofty room, and clothed with mystic spell ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€  ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ A massive oaken cabinet, and many a curious chair ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€  ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ ã€€ã€€ã€€ Bright armor of the olden time, and relics quaint and rare.  ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ I marked them well, --the gathered books, the painterâ€™s treasures all:  ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ ã€€ Here was the resting-place of day, whatever might befall;  ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ ã€€ The inner shrine of one whose brow the stamp of genius bore, ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ ã€€ And who the laurels of his fame with childlike meekness wore.  ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ Oh, many a slowly-waning hour this silent room alone ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ ã€€ Had seen the dreaming artist sit, like statue carved in stone;  ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ ã€€ Absorbed in patient watchfulness of all that Fancy brought, ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ã€€ ã€€ã€€ Gleanings of gladness or of gloom from out the fields of thought.', ''),

The American Art department looks for such portraiture with which our diverse audiences can identify.

He made studies for and may have painted there a series of watercolors and paintings of the life of rural blacks. Critics hailed him as the first artist to have seen the possibilities of this untapped source of subject matter. In a historical perspective one can see how exceptional these paintings are for their realism and sensitive treatment of their subjects in contrast to the caricatured portrayals Homer had joined others in painting during and after the Civil War period.  The Cotton Pickers is quite simply the artistâ€™s most monumental painting of the figure; that it should also be of black subjects is remarkable. In painting rural workers in such heroic terms, Homer was no doubt drawing upon a tradition well developed in various European countries by 1876, perhaps best known today in the work of Jean-Franqois Millet (1814-1875) and Jules Breton (1827-1906). Like them, Homer painted his rural workers as graceful majestic figures, but he chose as his subject unmistakably American materials. Homer brought the same respect and sympathy the French artists had for their nationâ€™s peasants to bear on his representations of American blacks. Presented from a low vantage point, these powerful figures fill the canvas and dominate the composition. They are also portrayed as individuals, the figure on the right, gazing into the distance, a particularly poignant image of inner life and of aspiration. The Cotton Pickers was the climax of Homerâ€™s early figural style, and one of his most profoundly original works.', ''),

Although it at first appears to be a straightforward nocturnal view of the beach and ocean, upon close scrutiny one sees a faint human face emerge in the cloudy sky. Similar images of a floating head appear in a group of Vedderâ€™s drawings from the late 1860s. Later he would be fascinated by the related classical motif of the head of Medusa. The theme of floating and severed heads was popular with the English Pre-Raphaelites, and at the end of the century it became a characteristic motif of the symbolists. Artists used such imagery to suggest states of mind and ideas of a personal nature rather than to describe the material world. The art historian Regina Soria has identified two of the artistâ€™s drawings as bases for the museumâ€™s painting: The Face in the Clouds, 1866 (Wunderlich & Co., New York, as of 1987), which was illustrated in Vedderâ€™s autobiography The Digressions of V. (p. 287), and a small drawing done the next year with the title Memory inscribed on its original mat (LACMA, see illustration). As the 1867 drawing was executed on March 19, the birthday of Carrie Rosekrans, Vedderâ€™s fiancÃ©e at that time, it has been assumed that the head in the two drawings and the oil painting was that of Rosekrans. If the drawings were intended to be portraits of Rosekrans, they would have had to have been done from memory for she was not with Vedder at the times of their execution. Actually, it is difficult to ascertain either the sex or the age of the face in any of the three. The head may be that of a child. When Vedder painted Memory, Rosekrans was pregnant with their first child, and some seven years later he was commissioned by a Mr. and Mrs. J. R. Dumaresq to make a similar painting using the face of their recently deceased son. Will South has noted that at least one contemporary of Vedderâ€™s, English critic William Davies, referred to the head in the drawing Memory with the neuter it (Art Pictorial and Industrial: An Illustrated Magazine 1 [September 1870]: 49). In none of Vedderâ€™s own writings does he suggest a particular person or type as the model for the floating head. Perhaps the ambiguity of the sex and age of the head was intentional, for such imagery accords well with the artistâ€™s lifelong fascination with imaginative subjects and his enthusiasm for a sense of mystery. According to the artistâ€™s annotation of the 1866 drawing The Face in the Clouds, he was inspired to create such a meditative image by Alfred Lord Tennysonâ€™s poem, Break, Break, Break (published 1842), in which the poet contemplates the sea and broods over the memory of lost ones. In Vedderâ€™s painting the insubstantial, miragelike face, in contrast to the sharp reality of the shore and waves, suggests the transitory nature of life and the dreamlike quality of memory. In its quiet, mysterious mood the painting is quite evocative. The mauve palette and spectral quality of the night lighting also place Memory within the formal and conceptual tenets of late nineteenth-century symbolism. In fact, Memory ranks as one of the earliest symbolist images by an American.', ''),

French academic training extolled the human form as the major vehicle of expression. Usually the student was forced to develop his draftsmanship through meticulous drawings. Only after gaining a command of the human figure was the student permitted to use paint.  Carolus-Duran was considered a radical in his methods because he encouraged his students to merge drawing with painting. He emphasized tonal painting as the means to construct form and stated, Search for the values.... Establish the half tints (la demiteinte) as a basis, then a few accents and the lights (quoted in Boston, Museum of Fine Arts, Catalogue of the Memorial Exhibition of the Works of the Late John Singer Sargent, exh. cat., 1925, text by J. Templeman Coolidge, p. ix). Following these tenets, Sargent built up the modelâ€™s face by applying lights and darks to convey the sense of three-dimensionality, reserving the strokes of the brightest flesh tints for the nose and chin. Sargentâ€™s strokes are swift and sure, without concern for minute details or surface finishing.

Kaplan (M.87.142)', 'Portrait of Cecilia Tower was one of Shannonâ€™s early mature works, painted and exhibited the year immediately following his first major critical success. He became best known for his portraits of women, and the museumâ€™s painting is characteristic of the type of decorative figure painting that brought him fame. Cecilia Tower is presented in neutral surroundings, allowing her dignified attitude, handsome attire, and the large size of the canvas to convey her social importance.  Following Whistler in viewing a portrait first as a work of art and typical of progressive artists allied with the Aesthetic movement, Shannon held that portraiture was more than merely reproducing a physical likeness of the sitter. In his portraits of women the refined beauty of all the formal elements-color, line, and composition-suggest elegance and wealth. Cecilia Tower wears a fashionable silk evening gown and a boa. The painting is an orchestration of gray tints. Shannon preferred a palette of softly modulated tones, and the lavenders and pearl grays of this canvas, along with pinks, were among his favorite hues. Delicacy of color contributes to the elegance of his portraits. Whistlerâ€™s example inspired a host of later artists to employ soft, tonally limited palettes and place their sitters in spare environments and shallow spaces. Another characteristic of Aesthetic movement portraits found in Cecilia Tower is that of showing the sitter full-length and in life-size.  The sitter was a member of the Tower family, landed gentry from Weald Hall in Essex. Cecilia Tower may have been Mrs. Christopher Tower. A portrait by Shannon of a child, Hugh Christopher Tower (unlocated), the son of Christopher Tower, was exhibited in the winter 1890-91 exhibition at the London Institute of Painters in Oil-Colours only a few years after Portrait of Cecilia Tower was shown in London. According to the art historian Barbara Dayer Gallati Shannon was often commissioned to paint different members of the same family.', ''),

He had a studio in the Villa Strohl-Fern, next to the Palazzo Borghese, where he modeled numerous figure studies in the manner of the antique. Of these apparently experimental works, only three survived: Caestus, modeled c. 1883-85 (casts of 1901, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.), The Scraper (Greek Athlete Using a Strigil), modeled c. 1883-85 (a cast at Brookgreen Gardens, Murrellâ€™s Inlet, S.C.), and the museumâ€™s Silenus. Niehausâ€™s study of the ideal figure in light of the antique calls to mind the work of Adolf von Hildebrand (18471921) in Florence during these years, although Hildebrandâ€™s influence among Munich-trained artists is thought to date from the exhibition of his work there in 1891. Until that decisive event, sculpture in Munich was shaped by an advanced, naturalistic movement with a somewhat rococo flavor. Niehausâ€™s early statues of Garfield and Allen are in this highly detailed, slightly agitated style. In the course of the 1880s this naturalistic trend culminated in such extreme manifestations as casts from life and tinted sculptures. A reaction among the younger artists led them to the simpler, stronger sculpture of antiquity, which they felt was animated by its coherent expression of the mechanism of movement. The three surviving antique figures from Niehausâ€™s years in Rome show that he sought a simpler, more powerful style in which organic movement and balance informed every pare of the figure. When compared with the noble, somewhat abstracted figures of Hildebrand, those of Niehaus seem highly naturalistic; The Scraperâ€™s great success at the Worldâ€™s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 was due to what was regarded as its unconventional realism. At the same time, one can discern in all three sculptures a shift to the more compact sense of form and more disciplined reserve in modeling that were to characterize Niehausâ€™s subsequent work, suiting him particularly for monumental sculpture. Sileni were Panlike woodland spirits resembling the satyrs. In Greek mythology, Silenus was the foster father and tutor of Dionysus and leader of the satyrs. He is traditionally depicted as a fat, drunken, old man, usually without the goatâ€™s legs and tail but with the pointed ears, upturned nose, and full beard of a satyr, and with heavy brows and high, full cheeks. An earlier, probably original version of Silenus (unlocated, illustrated in Armstrong, Sculpture of Niehaus, p. 60) has these traditional features, derived from ancient prototypes, that are absent from the museumâ€™s cast, except for the pointed ears. The earlier version differs in a few other details and in a finer, more naturalistic overall modeling. The pose, recalling the famous Dancing Faun from Pompeii (Museo Nazionale, Naples), remained the same. What appears to be a cast of this earlier version appears in a painting Inquisitive, 1893 (New York art market as of 1989), by Louis Charles Moeller (1855-1930). Casts of Caestus bear the date 1901, and it seems likely that The Scraper and Silenus also were cast about that time, although each bears the mark of a different foundry and thus they were not from a single campaign of casting. They represented Niehaus in important exhibitions early in the century.', ''),

Twachtman had received one of his earliest, favorable critical notices for the freshness of the views he painted in 1879 of unpicturesque wharves and shipping in New York harbor. In Gloucester he painted the countryside, but also close-up scenes of the ordinary wharves and fishing fleet. In this painting he seems to have set up his easel on the roof of one of the low sheds along the wharves, with one of the larger buildings to his left and behind him. This viewpoint looks down upon the deck of a large ship. judging from the forward position of the two masts that are visible, this may be a three-masted vessel, presumably one of the large Italian barks that brought salt for processing the fish in Gloucester. Much larger than the two-masted fishing schooners, the barks were higher in the water, their decks also higher than the level of the wharves built for the schooners.  Twachtman used a high vantage point in some of the other paintings he did in Gloucester, producing a similarly high horizon line, which, together with the tilted-up foreground and square format of the canvas, tends to deny the illusion of spacial recession. The surface grid, which is suggested by the way the parallel masts intersect the top edge of the painting and the horizon line parallel to it, also contributes to an awareness of the pictureâ€™s surface and the denial of depth. Counteracting these formal features is another familiar in the Gloucester paintings, the powerful, thrusting diagonal into space, along the length of the bark. An increased consciousness of pictorial geometry, its clear expression, and its use for dramatic effect are characteristic of Twachtmanâ€™s more explicit picture-making in his Gloucester paintings.  The design of Harbor Scene, painted on Twachtmanâ€™s largest canvas size of the period, is so strong that it reads clearly and forcefully even though the painting remained unfinished. Stimulated by the momentary scene and interested in problems of pictorial design, he began numerous paintings in Gloucester that he did not carry to completion. One sees in these unfinished paintings, as well as in the finished ones, a vigor of paint handling not seen in Twachtmanâ€™s work since his early period in Munich. His classic paintings of the previous decade employed underpainting to produce very delicate effects of limited color and value. The Gloucester pictures were painted directly, with the direction and texture of the paint clearly visible. The color is stronger, the contrasts greater, and the action of paint application is a matter of separate interest. The vigor and exceptional skill of Twachtmanâ€™s brush command attention in Harbor Scene.', '');

Portraits dominated the small field of painting. Victories on land and at sea in the War of 1812 brought the fledgling democracy greater confidence and new national pride. By 1829, when Andrew Jackson assumed the presidency, the foundations for an independent culture were securely laid. The philosopher-poet Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed the mood of the country in 1837: â€œour day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close.â€? The following decades would bring a swell of artistic creativity, focused on native themes that extolled the seemingly limitless bounty of the New World. <BR>Portraiture, and to a lesser extent history painting, continued to occupy American artists, but increasing numbers turned to views of the local countryside and its inhabitants. Although the industrial revolution only began in the United States after the War of 1812, the following three decades witnessed economic changes, especially in the north, that significantly affected working conditions, family structure, and even religion. Paintings illustrated American virtues like ingenuity and industry as well as the pleasures of country life. The new taste for genre picturesâ€?scenes of ordinary people involved in everyday activitiesâ€?seemed ideally suited to the egalitarian attitude of the Jacksonian era. <BR>This period also saw the rise of the countryâ€™s first truly national school of landscape painting, ultimately known as the Hudson River school. Its earliest, best-known exponent, Thomas Cole, sometimes painted romantic literary subjects in European settings, but his dramatic depictions of the American wilderness helped spur the popularity of American views. As the country developed, paintings of uninhabited wilderness were replaced by views of farms, towns, and factories, but American artists retained their sense of awe about the land.', ''),

The honor of being accepted presaged an artistâ€™s future success. Thousands of paintings, sculptures, and works on paper were presented at each Salon; the exhibition halls were so crowded that paintings were hung to the ceiling with sculptures scattered about. To be hung â€œon the lineâ€? (at eye level) meant a work of art ranked among the best in the show. Since a painting might be skied (hung near the ceiling), many artists painted on a large scale to ensure that their work could be seen no matter where it was placed. <BR>Contrary to earlier periods, American painting in the late 1800s was no longer dominated by a single aesthetic.

Sargent spent the month of June 1890 in Worcester, Massachusetts, fulfilling a commission he had received several months earlier to paint the portrait of Mrs. Edward Livingston Davis. Maria Robbins Davis (1843-1916) came from a distinguished Boston family and, at the time of Sargentâ€™s portrait, was one of Worcesterâ€™s most prominent women and the wife of a former mayor. The painting of Mrs. Davis with her son Livingston (1882-1932) was the most commanding and important of the portraits Sargent created in Worcester.  Sargent used the Davisesâ€™ stable for his studio because of its size and perhaps its empty black interior. In the portrait he avoided any allusions to the location and instead focused on the figures themselves, allowing their character and relationship to dominate. Sargent produced a complex psychological grouping in which the mother is contrasted with her child. Standing -- in the tradition of the formal, full-length portrait -- Mrs. Davis projects her upper-class breeding by her erect posture and frontal pose, yet she is also shown as a spirited woman and a mother of great warmth. While she and her son do not look at each other, they interact, albeit in a polite manner, through the tender grasp of hands and physical proximity The boy shyly leans toward his mother, and she responds by sheltering him with her left arm. In this and other family portraits Sargent masterfully avoided any sentimentality while sympathetically conveying his subjectsâ€™ personalities.  Sargent combined a dark palette with strong lighting, so that the overall effect is bright. Following the example of Carolus-Duran on close attention to values and the example of Spanish art, Sargent limited his palette largely to black and white while creating a colorful effect: there are subtle shifts from the cool blue-black of Mrs. Davisâ€™s dress to the warmer brown, black of the background, and touches of light blues in the shadows of the boyâ€™s sailor suit. Mrs. Davis and Her Son Livingston shows off Sargentâ€™s vigorous, fluid brushwork, most notably in the ruffles, fichu, and embroidery of Mrs. Davisâ€™s dress and the shadows of Livingstonâ€™s suit. Sargent combined his handling with an assured manipulation of dramatic lighting to firmly model the figures. He created a psychologically penetrating portrait as well as a technical tour-de-force.  Sargentâ€™s emulation of Spanish baroque painting is echoed in the faintly Spanish features of the portraitâ€™s original frame, designed by architect Stanford White.', ''),

The frontier moved westward as the forests of the Adirondacks, Catskills, and Alleghenys of the eastern seaboard were cleared and inhabited. Euro-American settlers pushed across the continent, through the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains, until they reached the Pacific Ocean. Although the actual travels of explorers, government surveyors, and settlers can be traced through the changing locales in landscape paintings, such depictions were to a certain extent idealizations. In the romantic-realist tradition of the Hudson River school, artists emphasized the primitive character of the wilderness and presented the newly cultivated farmlands as agrarian oases divinely blessed by rainbows and golden mists. <BR>Artists and writers promoted nature as a national treasure. However, the wealth of the land was measured in commercial as well as aesthetic terms. Railroads and axes appear in paintings as symbols of civilization, yet they also were instruments of destruction. <BR>According to some, the nation was preordained by God to span the continent from coast to coast. In 1845 the editor John Oâ€™Sullivan coined the term â€œManifest Destiny,â€? referring to the countryâ€™s duty to annex western territories and exploit their resources. The same railroad tycoons and land developers who promoted such a policy also commissioned artists to paint epic scenes of the American landscape. Manifest Destiny ignored the rights of Native Americans, who had inhabited the region long before European settlers arrived. Consequently, it is not surprising that Native Americans are absent from, or stereotyped in, most of the painted views of the land they called their home. The West seen in most nineteenth-century paintings was largely one of the imagination.', ''),

By 1920 more than half of the countryâ€™s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters.

Impressionism and postimpressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts. <BR>In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the â€œash can schoolâ€? because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. The realists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led the m t o create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America .

Knoedler & Co. in 1913. Although Moonlight: Walls of Tangiers has traditionally been dated 1914, based on William Preston Harrisonâ€™s authority, the painting may have been executed earlier, for several of the works exhibited in 1913 have similar titles, in particular one painting entitled Moonrise: Walls of Tangiers. Although the North African locale provided the same exotic scenery incorporated in Tannerâ€™s religious images, the Moroccan scenes are not religious.  The elimination of a narrative may have assisted Tanner in his exploration of the formal aspects of painting, for it is just during these prewar years that his art underwent its last stylistic change. Tanner used his views of the streets, walls, and arcades of the city to explore the phenomena of color and light, not in an analytical manner as did the impressionists, but rather in harmony with both his own romanticism and turn-of-the-century tonalist trends in Europe and the United States. The Moroccan paintings are all vague, shadowy scenes painted in one predominant hue with thick, scumbled passages over rich glazing on a white ground. The blue and green palette of Moonlight: Walls of Tangiers has shades of yellow, peach, and purple. Tanner had begun to experiment with pigments and glazes around 1907 and by World War I was almost exclusively using the complex technique of layered glazes. Perhaps it was his renewed acquaintance with the Orient that enabled Tanner to develop the more resonant and colorful painting style characteristic of his art from about 1910 until his death in 1937.', ''),

Thousands of artists were employed, most through the largest program, the Works Progress Administration.

As a result, most of the art created in the decade prior to World War II was humanistic in orientation. <BR>Artists, writers, and philosophers of the period became obsessed with the social relevance of art. Although a small group of American artists did attack the societal ills of the nation (housing shortages, unemployment) and of the world in general (the rise of fascism and militarism), most adopted a more pragmatic and even positive attitude. American scene painters captured busy city dwellers on streets, in buses, at work, and at play. Occasionally artists infused an element of humor into the pathos of everyday existence, even in scenes that allude to the political disasters of the day.

Szymanski in memory of Renate Lippert Szymanski (AC1993.233.1)', 'American art achieved cosmopolitan status in the decades following the nationâ€™s centennial with figure paintings such as The Trial of Constance de Beverly by Toby Rosenthal (1848-1917).  Although a scene set in the time of Henry VIII (1491-1547) the large canvas resonates of the 19th century and serves as a barometer of cultural taste.   Rosenthal was one of the earliest American expatriate artists to achieve international fame.  Prussian-born, he grew up in San Francisco but returned to Europe to enroll in the Royal Academy in Munich.  There he was introduced to the academic belief in the superiority of history painting.  Under Karl von Piloty, Rosenthal learned how to depict stories of an uplifting, moral character in dramatic, yet easily understood terms.   While he lived in Germany, Rosenthal received his most significant commissions from Americans.  In 1879 the San Francisco industrialist Irving M. Scott requested a scene from Marmion (1808), a romantic narrative poem by Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832).  The tale was a favorite of Rosenthalâ€™s patron, whose enthusiasm reflected the popularity of the Scotsmanâ€™s writings with the middle-class reading public.  Scottsâ€™ influence on 19th-century pictorial arts was equally pervasive, for beginning in the 1820s, his novels revolutionized history painting in Europe and America by providing artists with stories of a human character that had mass appeal.  The Trial of Constance de Beverly was a late example of such painting.   Marmion is a tale fraught with all the elements of a bestseller: romance, danger, abandonment, and death.  The story concerns Constance de Beverly, a beautiful young novice who is seduced into leaving the convent by Lord Marmion, a handsome but eventually faithless suitor.  Rosenthal chose not to delineate a romantic episode, but to focus on the tense courtroom drama as Constance awaits her fate at the hands of a clerical tribune.  In quite operatic fashion befitting medieval revival novels and history paintings, Rosenthal depicted the moment when a monk plucks Constanceâ€™s cloak from her shoulders to reveal her clothed as Lord Marmionâ€™s page: in the background two monks gleefully prepare the niche where she will be bricked-up alive for breaking her religious vows.  Rosenthal brilliantly exploited the romantic elements of gothic literature by heightening the sinister, almost ghoulish character of the scene through a cavernous setting, brownish-black palette, tenebrous lighting, and theatrical facial expressions.   Rosenthal sought complete accuracy in the details of the setting and costume.  He did depart dramatically from the story, however, by omitting Lord Marmion from the trial scene.  By doing so, Constance becomes the main protagonist, standing center stage, a heroine despite the tragedy of her situation.  Painted during a period when most women still had little control of their own lives, Rosenthalâ€™s Constance was someone who determined her own destiny.  After winning a gold medal at the 1883 Munich International Art Exhibition, the painting was exhibited in San Francisco to great acclaim.  Saved from the cityâ€™s 1906 earthquake and fire through quick thinking, it has remained in California ever since.', ''),

By 1920 more than half of the countryâ€™s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters.

Impressionism and postimpressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts. <BR>In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the â€œash can schoolâ€? because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. The realists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led the m t o create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America .

The painting is an example of her initial response to the Southwestern desert, when Oâ€™Keeffe first visited New Mexico in 1929.  She quickly became entranced with the landscape.  In 1921, writing from New Mexico to the New York critic Henry McBride, Oâ€™Keeffe explained that she had been collecting little and big bones â€“ shank bones and skulls of rams, cows, and horses â€“ that she found scattered in the desert.  â€œWhen I leave the landscape,â€? she wrote, â€œit seems I am going to work with these funny things that I now think feel so much like it.â€?  That year she began arranging the bones with artificial flowers and painting them as â€œa new way of trying to define [her] feeling about that country.â€?  The works received much critical acclaim when they were first exhibited in January 1932.  Horseâ€™s Skull with Pink Rose is a transitional painting linking Oâ€™Keeffeâ€™s earlier flower paintings, created in New York City, and her later desert paintings.  Oâ€™Keeffeâ€™s earlier paintings, the flower paintings of the 1920s, were richly hued and erotic and created quite a stir among the critics.  By 1931, however, Oâ€™Keeffe began to create softer desert flower-and-bone images that were completely different in spirit.  Intending to convey the mood of the desert, Oâ€™Keeffe restricted her palette to whites, blacks, and beiges that suggested the aridness and stark drama of desert life.  While the use of intense hues is still evident in Horseâ€™s Skull with Pink Rose, Oâ€™Keeffe simplified the palette into a contrast of a few dark/light colors.  The skull and flower are arranged on an abstract field of light color, thus suggesting rather than representing the desert.  Oâ€™Keeffeâ€™s fascination with bones continued throughout the decade, but later images of the skulls are juxtaposed against desert landscapes.  In both early and late bone paintings the wind-bleached skulls act as modern icons of the Southwest.   This painting marks the first work by Oâ€™Keeffe in the museumâ€™s American and modern art collection and is a fine example of her Southwestern period.', ''),

Thousands of artists were employed, most through the largest program, the Works Progress Administration.

Although a small group of American artists did attack the societal ills of the nation (housing shortages, unemployment) and of the world in general (the rise of fascism and militarism), most adopted a more pragmatic and even positive attitude. American scene painters captured busy city dwellers on streets, in buses, at work, and at play. Occasionally artists infused an element of humor into the pathos of everyday existence, even in scenes that allude to the political disasters of the day.

Cassatt was one of the foremost American artists of the 19th century.  Almost her entire career was spent in France as an expatriate, and it was there she became a confidant of Degas and a member of the radical circle of French impressionists.  The only American invited to exhibit with them in Paris, Cassatt first presented her famous â€œmother and childâ€? images at their annual shows.  Mother About to Wash Her Sleepy Child (1880), the museumâ€™s other Cassatt oil, is believed to be the artistâ€™s earliest dated modern Madonna.  Woman and Child is slightly smaller but equally rich in palette.   Manifold are the discussions about Cassattâ€™s maternal themes and their relationship both to her own life (she remained single, but lived in close rapport with her extended family) and to a contemporary religious revival in France.  Recently, scholars have begun questioning the identity of these so-called mothers, and clues can sometimes be found in their attire.  Is the woman in our 1880 painting the mother or a servant?  She appears to be wearing intimate at-home attire, but an upper-middle-class woman probably would have relegated the domestic chore of her childrenâ€™s toilet to a nursemaid.  One of Cassattâ€™s servants, Mathilde Vallet, often posed for the artist; but in the context of Woman and Child is she to be read as the mother?  There is not enough detail to know what she is wearing.  Moreover, although the young child hugs Mathilde, her eyes express a slight skepticism rather than the confidence one would expect.   Woman and Child actually has two subjects, for the paint surface is as significant as the imagery.  The canvas was intentionally left unfinished (it is signed), suggesting that the artist wanted the viewer to luxuriate in the paintâ€™s physicality.  Its surface consists of neutral-colored passages of underpaint as well as areas finished to varying degrees.  Cassatt varied her approach, using sweeping strokes, wiggles, parallel lines, and even rubbing out the pigment.  The canvas also offers insight into the artistâ€™s working methodology.  Typical of an academically trained artist, the faces are the most fully realized.  Yet Cassatt built up her three-dimensional forms, first drawing in cobalt blue a quick, sure outline, than applying strokes one over another so that her figures simultaneously suggest solidity and movement.  Cassatt had been criticized for her defective drawing by her teachers, who considered her approach slovenly.  Today we realize how brilliant a draftsman she was.   Mother About to Wash Her Sleepy Child and Woman and Child document Cassattâ€™s importance to both American and French painting.', ''),

That statue was modeled after a smaller bronze, of which the museumâ€™s sculpture is one of about fifteen known examples, all dated 1860. They are among the earliest American bronzes. Although Ward traveled to the Dakotas to study Native American life and physiognomy between his creation of the half-lifesize statuette and the statue in Central Park, the differences between the two sculptures are minor: in the outdoor Indian Hunter the arm holding the bow is slightly raised, the aboriginal quality of the face emphasized, the animal skin reduced, and shape of the base made rectangular rather than oval. Ward based the general pose of The Indian Hunter on the famous classical Borghese Gladiator (MusÃ©e du Louvre, Paris), which he may have known from a plaster cast. This bronze demonstrates Wardâ€™s skill at infusing a figure with an animated realism that was new to American sculpture. The surface of the manâ€™s body is highly polished, and extensive chasing developed texture in other areas. Ward contrasts the textures of the manâ€™s smooth skin, the coarse, thick hair of the pelt, and the soft, curly fur of the dog. Moreover, the poses are those of suspended animation as the hunter stalks his prey, momentarily holding back his dog to concentrate on the quarry. Wardâ€™s choice of subject matter was important to the workâ€™s success. Mid-nineteenth-century artists had only recently turned to the Native American as a subject. Articles such as The Indian in American Art in the 1856 issue of The Crayon encouraged them to depict his character before he disappeared. Wardâ€™s teacher, Henry Kirke Brown, had been the first to do so in bronze, and Ward first modeled this figure while still in Brownâ€™s studio. Some of the approximately fifteen known casts of the statuette of The Indian Hunter bear the mark of the Henry-Bonnard Bronze Company, New York, and others that of the Gorham Company, Providence, R.I.; yet others were cast by unknown foundries. Three larger than life-size casts are recorded (see Sharp, Ward, pp. 147-49 for list of known examples).', ''),

In the late 1870s, Peto entered the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where he became friends with William Harnett, recently returned to the academy after several years in New York City.  It was about this time that Harnett began exhibiting his mature illusionistic still lifes.  Although most still life painters aim to be convincingly realistic, Harnett went beyond mere imitation, often to the point of deception.  These still lifes made Harnettâ€™s fame and spawned a virtual movement of followers.  Peto considered Harnett his ideal of perfection in still life painting, and as Harnett, specialized in still lifes, both table-top compositions and trompe lâ€™oeil (deceives the eye).  Yet Peto was no mere imitator.  Unlike many of his contemporaries, Peto did not consider the visual trickery and illusion so often associated with works of trompe lâ€™oeil as the sole aim of his art.  In Harnettâ€™s paintings, objects were depicted so realistically that many people actually had to touch the canvas before they were convinced that the objects they were seeing were painted, not real. Peto, however, was more concerned with the manner in which light could affect an object rather than with the precise rendering of that object, and his canvases have a softer, less hard-edged style.ã€€  Peto left Philadelphia in the late 1880s, marrying Christine Pearl Smith and spending the rest of his life in Island Heights, New Jersey, away from the cosmopolitan art centers.  His painting had received little recognition in Philadelphia, and Peto ceased to promote his work after settling on the New Jersey shore.  In Island Heights, Peto and his wife made at least part of their living through Petoâ€™s cornet playing and by running a summer boarding house for vacationers.  Peto continued painting, and many of his works including smaller still lifes are presumed to have been sold to these boarders as souvenirs.ã€€  Harnett and most of his contemporaries delineated in their still lifes finely bound books, musical instruments, vases, handsome stationery, and other objects that were emblematic of â€“ and therefore more salable to â€“ a wealthy and educated class.  Peto, on the other hand, depicted humbler objects â€“ torn envelopes, broken latches, inexpensive pottery, and burnt matches.  Scholars have suggested that his decision to concentrate on banal subject matter had much to do with the lukewarm reception his work received during his lifetime; neither buyers nor critics felt that these ordinary objects were models worthy of artistic reproduction.  With time Petoâ€™s canvases took on more personal associations and became even more distinctly darker palette and more modest objects, older and worn, arranged in a state of disarray, perhaps indicative of Petoâ€™s way of life as well as his frustration over the failure of his art to garner critical praise and an appreciative audience.ã€€ã€€ Rack pictures such as this one comprised a large part of Petoâ€™s oeuvre from 1879 to 1904, and he was a master of this type of trompe lâ€™oeil composition.  The term rack refers to the practice â€“ common in business offices at the time â€“ of affixing to the wall or a board a square of cloth tape with additional cloth-tape crosses inside.  Notes, mail, advertisements, and miscellaneous objects were then tacked on to the tape.  The rack picture offered Peto a unique challenge in trompe lâ€™oeil, because he had to create the illusion that actual objects were in a narrow, almost flat space.  Petoâ€™s rack pictures can be divided into two distinct periods, the first dating between 1879 and 1885 and the second between 1894 and 1904.  The racks in the early works have more complex tape grids, with some of the details of the objects elaborately conveyed; the objects also show less deterioration.  HSPâ€™s Rack Picture is from the latter period, during which Petoâ€™s work became increasingly subjective.  These later works are characterized by dark green or brown backgrounds and by single squares of crossed tape that were more frequently frayed and torn.ã€€  HSPâ€™s Rack Picture, one of Petoâ€™s bigger paintings, is the largest of the rack pictures and represents the culmination of his work in this genre.  It incorporates many elements familiar from his earlier paintings, such as the hanging lantern, key, old books, envelopes, and a small oil sketch of a book and a mug.  New to this work are the large wrought-iron hinges, their rough texture and curving silhouettes animating the composition.  Although painted, the artistâ€™s signature as well as the initial HSP appear to be cut into a painted wooden backboard, thereby heightening the illusion of an actual business rack.  Peto authority John Wilmerding has described the painting as one of Petoâ€™s most beautiful and poignant late works, in which the muted colors and worn elements convey a restrained sense of sad discomfort.  The artist was then suffering the pain of Bright â€™s disease, and the strong solid letters of his daughterâ€™s initials indicate how important a place she occupied in his family life.  The painting is about the salvaging of order and beauty in the face of anxiety and collapse. Although the initials, HSP, refer to Petoâ€™s only daughter, Helen Serrill Peto, there are fewer explicit individual references than in earlier rack pictures.  Rack pictures that were private commissions often included personalized details that could be related to that person or business, such as an envelope address, a printed advertisement, or letterhead.  While many of his contemporaries would have delineated the script in the addresses of envelopes or advertisements, Peto omitted these details.  The stationery in HSPâ€™s Rack Picture became simple rectangular shapes or color, elemental parts in the overall design of his composition. Peto had moved away from strict representation, and design became his primary focus.  He began to conceive of his painting in more formal, abstract terms, and this additional dimension removes the work from the 19th-century trompe lâ€™oeil and places it within the birth of 20th-century modernism.  Harnettâ€™s work was resurrected in the 1930s when commercial dealers and art historians found new interest in realist art from the preceding century.  A decade later, in the late 1940s Petoâ€™s work was rediscovered by Alfred Frankenstein, a Northern California-based art critic.  Frankenstein unearthed unusual discrepancies in both the style and the subject matter of paintings that had been attributed to Harnett.  Through diligent and exhaustive detective work, and with the assistance of conservation specialists, art historians, and countless individuals, Frankenstein found that nearly one-third of the works signed with Harnettâ€™s name (probably by various dealers after his death) were in fact painted by other artists, among them John Frederick Peto.  Petoâ€™s work could finally receive the recognition it had not been afforded for decades.ã€€  In the late 1980s Peto became as popular as Harnett with collectors.  He is now not only viewed as one of the principal exponents of the late 19th-century trompe lâ€™oeil movement, but appreciated for his distinctive proto-modernist aesthetic.

He began visiting the Laguna area in 1907. In this early canvas Puthuff accurately caught the spirit of the gently rolling coastal mountains. After settling in California, Puthuff fell in love with the openness and freedom of such hills. The landscape is a classic example of the eucalyptus school, with its emphasis on the empty, sun-filled hills of Southern California. When this painting was exhibited at a group show during the early years of the new Los Angeles Museum, the Los Angeles Times critic Antony Anderson praised Puthuff for capturing the lovely golden brown of Southern Californiaâ€™s hills in summer.

Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph.

In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters.

At the left are white lilies, symbols of purity and virtue, and irises, which are named for Iris, messenger of the gods in Greek mythology and the personification of the rainbow. The colors of the rainbow appear behind Royce''''s head in a mountainous landscape dominated by peaks of blue-violet, the introspective, the inspirational color. The pattern of the red silk dress she wears repeats the yin-yang symbol, which represents the intertwining of the female principle, yin, with the male principle, yang, in Eastern philosophy. An actress of some renown, Royce had been married to prominent Hollywood producer Josef von Sternberg, and she and Macdonald-Wright were involved from the late 1920s through 1933. The increasing seriousness of his relationship with Royce impelled Macdonald-Wright to leave Los Angeles in May of 1932 for New York, where he joined Royce and painted this portrait.      In the painting Royce wears a jade bracelet that was a gift to her from Macdonald-Wright very early in their relationship. Reportedly carved from a single piece of jade (there are no seams in the circular pieces), the bracelet is also worn by Royce in a photograph of her taken about 1929-1930. In China, jade is revered for its beauty and spiritual qualities, and the bracelet was probably symbolic to both Macdonald-Wright and Royce on many levels. It descended in the family through their daughter, Linfa Riza Wright (1933-2001), who donated this painting and the three graphite drawings by her father to the museum.

Toward these ends, he established various new federal agencies, putting many more people to work to do the increased business of government. Thousands of artists were employed, most through the largest program, the Works Progress Administration. Although the government did not dictate the type of art that was to be produced, it did encourage the use of a representational style and American themes. As a result, most of the art created in the decade prior to World War II was humanistic in orientation. <BR>Artists, writers, and philosophers of the period became obsessed with the social relevance of art. Although a small group of American artists did attack the societal ills of the nation (housing shortages, unemployment) and of the world in general (the rise of fascism and militarism), most adopted a more pragmatic and even positive attitude.

Economic growth, spurred by new technologies such as the railroad and telegraph, assisted the early stages of empire building. As a comfortable and expanding middle class began to demonstrate its wealth and power, a fervent nationalist spirit was celebrated in the writings of Walt Whitman and Herman Melville. Artists such as Emanuel Leutze produced history paintings re-creating the glorious past of the relatively new country. Such idealizations ignored the mounting political and social differences that threatened to split the country apart. The Civil War slowed development, affecting every fiber of society, but surprisingly was not the theme of many paintings. The warâ€™s devastation did not destroy the American belief in progress, and there was an undercurrent of excitement due to economic expansion and increased settlement of the West. <BR>During the postwar period Americans also began enthusiastically turning their attention abroad.

They were admired now for their intrinsic qualities and deemed as finished, independent works. As a result, artists began exhibiting them as such. Working in pastel became so popular in the United States that a group of New York artists in 1884 organized the Society of Painters in Pastel. In 1890 Thomas Dewing, one of America''''s premier figure painters, adopted pastel, and within a short time became one of the leading proponents in the field. The medium was a perfect match for his subject matter and aesthetics. Dewing specialized in elegant and poetic interpretations of upper class young women, usually enveloped in a haze of atmosphere or mist. Whether set in a garden or a room, his lovely women seem quite unreal, their beautiful faces idealized into aristocratic portraits and their sweeping gowns transformed into diaphanous gauze. All appears dreamlike. Pastels allowed Dewing to convey an even greater sense of insubstantiality and softness than did his oils. The young woman sitting in the rattan chair definitely exists as her upright posture and strong shoulders indicate, but the shimmering gown that swaths her body seems to almost disappear. Beauty for beauty''''s sake became the aesthetic motto of Dewing''''s world. Dewing probably first explored the new graphic medium as a result of his seeing James A. M. Whistler''''s popular 1889 exhibition of pastels at Wunderlich Gallery in New York City. Dewing was a great admirer of the American expatriate as they shared similar attitudes towards art. Dewing would eventually visit Whistler in Europe and study his work at the home of Charles Freer, whose collection included many examples by Whistler. As did Whistler, Dewing viewed subject matter only as a means to create an art that went beyond recording. With both men, an art work constituted its own formal elements and references to the exterior world were minimized. Both men viewed painting and drawing as visual harmonies analogous to the concept of music. Dewing also borrowed from Whistler a preference for small scale and the use of colored paper (Dewing preferred a finer texture). He followed Whistler''''s practice of cutting the paper into approximately 10 1/2 x 6 3/4 in. format until around 1920 when he began producing larger examples specifically for exhibition. In 1909, Dewing also began adding a small number below his signature for record keeping. As Lady in Rattan Armchair does not have such a number, it dates from before that time. This drawing will be the first work by Dewing to enter LACMA''''s collection, complimenting the collection of late nineteenth-century figure painting.', ''),

Biggers was born in 1924 in Gastonia, North Carolina into a large family that made education their highest priority. In 1937, Biggers''''s mother enrolled him in Lincoln Academy, a private boarding school for African American children in Kings Mountain, North Carolina. There Biggers was taught by a former missionary to West Africa, who encouraged the students to embrace African heritage. In 1941, Biggers enrolled at Hampton Institute (now University) in Virginia intending to study plumbing but was drawn to art courses. Several professors recognized and encouraged his talent and interest in drawing. Austrian ?igr?Viktor Lowenfeld, an artist, art historian and Bauhaus member who had survived the Holocaust, taught his students to confront issues of inequality in their art. Artist-in-residence at Hampton, the renowned painter and muralist Charles White, especially fostered Biggers''''s abilities to employ narrative and an intensified realism to portray scenes of racial injustice and poverty in his art with extreme pathos, such as Cotton Pickers (1947; LACMA). Biggers was drafted into the U.S. Navy in 1943. The mural he created that year, Dying Soldier, was exhibited in the Young Negro Art exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. After World War II, Biggers earned B.S. and M.S. degrees in Art Education from Pennsylvania State University and, in 1949, established the art department at Texas State University for Negroes (now Texas Southern University) in Houston, where he made his career, teaching at Texas Southern until 1983. The completion of his 1953 mural, The Contribution of Negro Women to American Life and Education for a Houston YWCA, became the subject of Biggers''''s doctoral dissertation, and he earned his Ph.D. in Education from Penn State the following year. A 1957 trip to Ghana in West Africa, transformed Biggers''''s career, and he began to incorporate further his greater awareness of African culture into his images of African American life.  Actively painting until his death in 2001, Biggers painted numerous public murals on commission and received many awards for distinguished artistic and teaching accomplishments over the course of his career. He is also renowned for such easel paintings as Shotguns (1987; private collection, Houston), which references Shotgun houses, an African-influenced form of architecture prevalent in the South. Biggers was the subject of over 20 solo exhibitions and dozens of group shows. In 1995, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston presented a major retrospective of his career: The Art of John Biggers: View from the Upper Room.', ''),

There are several reasons for this. Spouses, children, and other relatives tend to be close at hand and consequently often available, and they pose for free. In the case of spouses, often there is also a romantic interest that strengthens the bond between sitter and painter. That may have been the case with the early-twentieth-century American realist George Bellows, who painted his wife numerous times throughout their marriage. In fact, it was Bellows?s depiction of his wife, Emma, in the summer of 1919 that led him to focus increasingly on portraiture. In 2007, the Margaret and Raymond J. Horowitz Foundation generously gave LACMA George Bellows?s Emma in the Purple Dress, the first of several large-scale, single-figure compositions that the artist painted of his wife. The painting was inspired by a typical wifely action that resulted in a not so typical husbandly response. Emma arrived home from a shopping spree excited about showing George her new purchase, a beautiful bolt of silk that she intended to sew into a skirt to match one of her favorite blouses. George was so impressed by the vivacity of the resulting ensemble that, after the skirt was finished, he quickly painted his wife wearing the new outfit. Evidence that it was a shared enthusiasm is seen in a photograph of Emma (Bellows Papers, Amherst College) holding out her skirt, pleased to be all decked out in the elaborately shirred and ruffled outfit. While Emma?s mood in the photograph is lighthearted, the creation of a large canvas inspired a more somber mood. Emma is quiet and composed. But her happiness as well as George?s relish in painting her is clearly expressed through the exuberant brushwork and the sheen of the fabric. Years after the painting was created, Emma noted that she did ?not know why he [George] called it Emma in the Purple Dress, since the skirt was rose-colored and the jacket blue.? Historians have suggested that Bellows changed the hues as a matter of artistic license. While that is also true, Bellows?s ultimate choice of colors may have resulted from the artist?s relationship with Hardesty Maratta, a paint supplier who also dabbled in color theory. Robert Henri, John Sloan, and other New York colleagues of Bellows avidly experimented with Maratta?s ideas, especially his use of triads of complementary colors, chosen like notes of a musical scale, to establish a particular harmony and mood. Maratta?s specially prepared paints encouraged a rich palette such as that seen in Emma in the Purple Dress. Emma in the Purple Dress points to a new direction in Bellows?s art. His formal portraits of the 1920s reveal a new seriousness with their balanced and severely geometrical compositions and dramatic dark backgrounds, a seriousness that relates to the art of Thomas Eakins, whose 1917 retrospective at New York?s Metropolitan Museum of Art greatly impressed Bellows. Like Eakins, Bellows began to focus more on the character and inner life of his sitters. The quiet intensity of Emma suggests a poignancy and a sense of the heroic and tragic. It is this mood that enabled Bellows to depart from the contemporaneity of a photograph and his earlier genre paintings to create timeless images such as Emma in the Purple Dress.', ''),

Painted after a lost original by Charles Bird King, Inmanâ€™s portrait of No-Tin is an early and defining example of American artistsâ€™ efforts, pre-photography, to depict Native Americans for national posterity. The portrait is also a testament to a critical moment in the history of Native Americans. Because Inmanâ€™s portrait survives, we know that No-Tin, which means Wind, was a Chippewa chief who came with his tribeâ€™s delegation to Washington DC in the mid-1820s. Nothing is known of No-Tinâ€™s own experiences during that visit, but he was one of scores of tribal leaders invited to the capitol by the U.S. government for negotiations, tours, and an audience with the President. The Chiefs would stay for several weeks, even months, for meetings and to experience Anglo American culture, all part of a federal diplomatic effort to pave the way for Indian removal and westward expansion. This mission was cultivated most influentially by Thomas L. McKenney, head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, a division of the U.S. Department of War. McKenney had also made it his mission to collect and preserve Native American materials for a national collection. But it was the Indian delegations that inspired McKenney to add portraits to his collection and create a national Indian Gallery. In 1822, he commissioned King, a Washington DC portraitist, to capture their faces. The project was an attempt to produce visual documents that might represent and preserve the power he knew these Chiefs would soon lose. The Chippewa, a corruption of the tribe name Ojibwa, were one of the largest and most powerful tribes in the Great Lakes territory and had extensive influence in the European fur trade. They controlled ore-rich, forested lands which they were largely able to protectâ€?until 1837. In fact, No-Tin has been cited for his attempt to improve the conditions at Fort Snelling, in what is now Minnesota, where the Chippewa had to negotiate that 1837 treaty. No-Tin implored that the federal agents to provide better food rations, specifically more beef, for the tribe as they prepared to negotiate the inevitable cession of their lands: You have everything around you, and can give us some of the cattle that are around us on the prairie. Kingâ€™s picture of No-Tin and over 130 other Indian Chiefs were all on permanent display to the public in the War Department offices, a major feature of all travel accounts and guides to the capitol. The passage of the Indian Removal Act in 1830 further encouraged McKenney to make the portraits in the Indian Gallery as widely available to the public as possible. He knew that only a successful artist, one more accomplished and ambitious than King, could produce the kind of compelling paintings that would become well known outside Washington. That artist was Henry Inman. Inman is among the best American artists of the early-nineteenth century. He established his studio in New York in 1824, quickly building his reputation as one of the most sought-after portraitists of his day, at a time when portraiture dominated artistic activity. Inman regularly received coveted commissions from the government and from the nationâ€™s leading families. The Inman versions of the Indian portraits are original works of art in their own right. Such paintings reference a long and proud art historical tradition of copying masterpieces, as well as give us a unique perspective on lost originals. Kingâ€™s originals were small records of his sitters. Inman enlarged the size of his canvases to make an artistic statement. Inmanâ€™s decision to increase the scale not only enhanced the significance of his paintings but also of each Chief. His large portraits deliberately put the Indian sitters on par with his renowned paintings of other prominent Americans. Inmanâ€™s portraits attained even greater significance after Kingâ€™s portraits were transferred to the Smithsonian Institutionâ€™s art gallery, which burned in 1865, destroying all of Kingâ€™s originals, including No-Tin. Inmanâ€™s portrait of No-Tin is in its original frame, and Inman beautifully painted No-Tinâ€™s Chippewa costume details, such as the pink ostrich plume, the customized eagle feather, bead choker and orange and white face paint, decorations that would have been worn for special occasionsâ€?especially a diplomatic visit, or a portrait sitting, in Washington. No-Tin is wrapped elegantly in a green, possibly felt, blanket, the likes of which were commonly traded. His character is conveyed especially through his direct and steady gaze. Inmanâ€™s art has prevented No-Tin from being lost to history. This rare portrait represents the inextricable place of American Indians in our national story, an essential perspective previously missing from LACMAâ€™s presentation of American art. Now LACMA comprehensively represents the diverse faces of early America. Austen Bailly, Assitant Curator, American Art, (2008)', ''),

Lauded for his innovative mature works by such critics and authors as Harold Rosenberg, Clement Greenberg, and Robert Goldwater, Gorky underwent a long apprenticeship before developing his personal, transformative works of an Abstract Expressionist character. Jim Jordan, co-author of the Catalogue RaisonnÃ© of Gorky''''s paintings, has noted that study of the early paintings from Gorky''''s formative decades of the 1920s and 1930s, such as Still Life, circa 1928, revealed a number of unities through Gorky''''s entire oeuvre. Born Vosdanik Adoian in Armenia, the teenage Gorky arrived in the United States in 1920 and eventually settled in New York City in 1925, only a few years after starting to paint. The next fifteen years he virtually taught himself by experimenting and analyzing the modernist movements as espoused by Europeans during the first four decades of the twentieth century. In this respect, he was typical of many young American artists and students who looked to the Old World for inspiration. In a now often-cited 1926 New York Evening Post interview, Gorky referred to himself as a rebel protesting the provincialism of New York and praising the modern masters Cezanne, Matisse, and Picasso. He went through a series of phases quickly absorbing the concepts of these modern Masters. His Self-Portrait, circa 1928, also owned by LACMA, is a synthesis of his response to Cezanne and Matisse, while Still Life, from the same period, is more fauve in character. Gorky does seem to be indebted to Cezanne and even Manet in the still life components â€? round fruit and slanting table knife â€? but Matisse''''s influence is particularly strong in the composition and the use of dark contour lines. Applying paint thickly and roughly, Gorky created a sparkling rich canvas despite the simplicity of the table-top arrangement. Moreover, the intense hues of citrus greens, warm roses and pinks, and deep cobalt blues â€? far more dynamic than in his Self Portrait â€? convey his fondness for color. It also offers a fascinating comparison with a later Gorky Still Life, circa 1936-1938, that LACMA also owns, in which the artist further developed a similar table-top still life motif into an synthetic cubist painting dominated by a limited palette with flat white planes and thick black outlines. Such modernist canvases a la Cezanne, Matisse, and Picasso, were a ritual coming of age for most American art students, working both abroad and in the United States. This Matisse-like Still Life by Gorky along with his cubist Still Life as well as similar examples by Stanton Macdonald-Wright created in Paris and by Hugh Breckenridge painted in Philadelphia exemplify in LACMA''''s collection the course of early modernism in the United States.

He was not only one of the leading American Scene painters of the 1930s, but later became one of the foremost teachers in the country as well as a significant organizer of exhibitions. He was also an important practitioner in the field of design. Today, Sheet''''s contribution to the decorative arts is most often identified with his Home Savings and Loan buildings. Beginning in 1954 and through his association with financier Howard Ahmanson, his most enthusiastic supporter, Sheets designed the buildings and decorations â€? mainly mosaic and painted murals, stained glass windows, and sculptures â€? for 40 bank branches throughout southern California. Many of these were actually studio creations; Sheets taught and then hired his students to assist in the design and creation of the modern mosaic murals, thereby encouraging the following generation of designers, artisans, and painters. However, Sheets'''' involvement in design began much earlier. While still a student at Chouinard School of Art in the late 1920s, he began painting murals and doing architectural designs for private clients. According to his son, Tony Sheets, Millard became committed early on to the concept of art in architecture â€? the idea of architects and artists working together f or a combined outcome â€? as opposed to art on architecture, where the architect places art on his already completed building as an afterthought. Less well documented and definitely little known and seen are his private commissions for painted murals that decorate the dining and living rooms of private homes (some of which Sheets designed himself) throughout the area. The murals were often lyrical landscapes of the rolling hills and terrain of California, and demonstrate another genre in which the artist excelled â€? landscape painting. Some time in either the late 1920s or early 1930s, Sheets also experimented with the folding screen format. Painted screens became quite popular during the interwar years in the United States and even Regionalists as famous as Thomas Hart Benton explored the genre. It is not known exactly why Sheets began painting screens or whether he was aware of the Russian and German Bauhaus belief that modern art could improve the life of everyday people through thoughtful design. He no doubt was familiar with the Arts and Crafts movement so strong in Southern California. Whatever his source and initial inspiration, the folding screen enabled Sheets to combine in a single work of art his two main interests â€? painting and the decorative arts. Later he would collect Japanese and Chinese screens. It is not known how many of folding screens Sheets actually completed, but only two are presently known and located. In both examples, Sheets presented more of a generic, idealized landscape rather than a specific scene of California, although in this example the imagery does suggest aspects of the state''''s rugged coastlline. Across the six panels, the shore view of rocks and sea is seen from high up, with wind-bent, leafless trees framing the view and directing the eye toward the distance, as large ferns and other plants blow in the wind. Swirling lines of the water near the beach and the bold outlines of rocks and plants create an incessant feeling of movement. The colors are strong but limited in number. The screen shares formal qualities that are the hallmark of Sheets'''' 1930s easel paintings: bold design, rich coloration, and unusual perspectives. Such bold stylized forms would reappear in Sheets'''' art much later, especially characterizing his postwar landscapes, and provide them a decorative feeling. The museum has a significant collection of Sheets'''' work, including his most famous painting, Angel''''s Flight, 1930 (one of the American Art Department''''s top ten paintings) and a related drawing for it, prints as well as examples of his war work, and popular late watercolors.', ''),

She lived in France during part of the 1950s and 1960s and it was there that she painted Journeying Blue. Her work of this period shared with her husband''''s an overall composition of colorful abstract forms noted for their glowing transparency. However, Baber worked with more controlled geometric shapes, usually ovoids, and applied the pigment by rubbing it into the canvas with her fingers rather than pouring the liquid in large gestural sweeps as did Jenkins. The energy of her paintings derived mainly from the congested yet orchestrated movement, often elliptical, of the shapes, which she referred to as wind; often the ovoids were directed towards a brilliant unstained white area near the center of the composition. Sometimes, as in Journeying Blue, her paintings tended toward the monochromatic. Baber is not as well known as the other exponents of stain painting because she died at a relatively young age of fifty-four and devoted considerable time to teaching throughout the United States (including at the University of California campuses at Santa Barbara and Berkeley), organizing exhibitions of women artists, and writing about art.

A sense of gloomy uncertainty tinged with anxious anticipation pervades the scene in which spare touches of bright green in the middle ground signal the gradual arrival of spring. The dense accumulation of arrow-point brushstrokes in the forested, roof-lined background merges into the foreground forms of tree trunks and branches and their reflection, creating a rich visual pattern and sense of vibration typical of Burchfield''''s best work, which also has a sonic quality. Specter-like white areas in the center of the painting and in the upper branches of the large tree at left appear to be deliberately scraped away rather than unfinished: traces of underlying forms can be detected through the roughened paper over which Burchfield very thinly layered diluted white gouache. These erasures evoke the mysteries of seasonal transformation. A native of Ohio, Charles Burchfield specialized in painting watercolors that expressed extraordinary aspects of ordinary natural and urban environments. He is renowned for the ecstatic images of nature he began painting around 1917, his self-professed golden year, his large scale paintings of the American scene, and monumental late paintings in which he revised and expanded his early work. Trained at the Cleveland School of Art, Burchfield settled permanently in Buffalo, New York in 1921, and worked for eight years as a designer for the prominent wall paper company, M.H. Birge & Sons, before devoting himself full time to his painting in 1929. His 1930 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York was the first single-artist retrospective ever held at the museum. Burchfield''''s America, published in Life magazine in December 1936, cited the artist as one of the ten greatest painters in the country.', ''),

Economic growth, spurred by new technologies such as the railroad and telegraph, assisted the early stages of empire building. As a comfortable and expanding middle class began to demonstrate its wealth and power, a fervent nationalist spirit was celebrated in the writings of Walt Whitman and Herman Melville. Artists such as Emanuel Leutze produced history paintings re-creating the glorious past of the relatively new country. Such idealizations ignored the mounting political and social differences that threatened to split the country apart. The Civil War slowed development, affecting every fiber of society, but surprisingly was not the theme of many paintings. The warâ€™s devastation did not destroy the American belief in progress, and there was an undercurrent of excitement due to economic expansion and increased settlement of the West. <BR>During the postwar period Americans also began enthusiastically turning their attention abroad. They flocked to Europe to visit London, Paris, Rome, Florence, and Berlin, the major cities on the Grand Tour. Art schools in the United States offered limited classes, so the royal academies in Germany, France, and England attracted thousands of young Americans. By the 1870s American painting no longer evinced a singleness of purpose.

Lewis Mumford, one of the countryâ€™s most brilliant thinkers, explained that, unlike Europe, â€œthe New World expanded the human imagination.â€? Young American students still traveled to Europe, especially Paris, for their initiation to art, but the progressive new ideas of cubism, futurism, and surrealism that they imbibed only found their true home in the United States. <BR>As demonstrated by the first generation of modernists in the circle of Alfred Stieglitz, American artists rarely abandoned referential ties to the physical world completely. The simplification of form, multiple perspectives, and ideas about the fourth dimension that radical proponents of cubism espoused would find their most compelling American expressions in the fishermen of Marsden Hartley, and the animal bones and skulls of Georgia Oâ€™Keeffe. To these artists, abstraction meant the synthesis of personal experience. <BR>The introduction of psychological ideas, first in the form of Sigmund Freudâ€™s discussion of the unconscious and later in the writings and art of the surrealists, found an enthusiastic audience in America. Such new concepts not only expanded ideas about the human mind but also encouraged the liberation of social conduct, in particular, sexual mores. Women increasingly became involved in creative aspects of the new modern age. In 1934 the Los Angeles artists Helen Lundeberg and Lorser Feitelson issued the only surrealist manifesto to appear in the United States, thereby demonstrating that in a relatively short time California had seriously challenged New York as the leader of the brave new world.', ''),

Thousands of artists were employed, most through the largest program, the Works Progress Administration. Although the government did not dictate the type of art that was to be produced, it did encourage the use of a representational style and American themes. As a result, most of the art created in the decade prior to World War II was humanistic in orientation. <BR>Artists, writers, and philosophers of the period became obsessed with the social relevance of art. Although a small group of American artists did attack the societal ills of the nation (housing shortages, unemployment) and of the world in general (the rise of fascism and militarism), most adopted a more pragmatic and even positive attitude. American scene painters captured busy city dwellers on streets, in buses, at work, and at play. Occasionally artists infused an element of humor into the pathos of everyday existence, even in scenes that allude to the political disasters of the day. Regionalists were particularly fond of idealizing the past and aggrandizing the present accomplishments of the country. In fact, the myth of America as a country where everyone lives a pastoral, carefree existence emerged with new vigor in the art of the 1930s. <BR>The diversity of the people also emerged as a strong current of social realism.

But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this â€œnew paintingâ€? was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.', ''),

By the late nineteenth century the Paris Salon was the most important exhibition space in the Western world. Artists from many nations would submit their best works to its annual exhibition. The honor of being accepted presaged an artistâ€™s future success. Thousands of paintings, sculptures, and works on paper were presented at each Salon; the exhibition halls were so crowded that paintings were hung to the ceiling with sculptures scattered about. To be hung â€œon the lineâ€? (at eye level) meant a work of art ranked among the best in the show. Since a painting might be skied (hung near the ceiling), many artists painted on a large scale to ensure that their work could be seen no matter where it was placed. <BR>Contrary to earlier periods, American painting in the late 1800s was no longer dominated by a single aesthetic. Munich-school paintingsâ€?narrative scenes, often based on literature or history and painted in a dark paletteâ€?as well as small figure paintings in the realist tradition were popular in both France and the United States. Large portraits represent the academic style that dominated official taste during this era. Bright, sun-drenched scenes by a more progressive group of artists, the impressionists are diametrically opposite in color, mood, and concept to muted tonalist and symbolist works. Whereas the impressionists celebrated contemporary life with all its transformations, the tonalists and symbolists created hazily illuminated, dreamlike imagery. <BR>Sculptures range from academic examples of idealized mythological imagery to expressions of the newer interest in the emotive potential of the human form. Equestrian bronzes by Frederic Remington demonstrate that at the turn of the century there was a continuing enthusiasm for heroic depictions of the West despite the increased internationalism of American taste.', ''),

Along with his classicism went a modernist interest in color and form, which was inspired in part by Paul CÃ©zanne (1839-1906) and Pablo Picasso (1881-1973). The woman in Seated Figure is fully modeled, as would be expected of an academically trained artist such as Karfiol, but her body has been simplified into solid geometric forms. She is placed in the center of the composition, sitting on a stool. The stool is actually too small and low to enable the woman, who is quite massive, to sit comfortably. She appears to be comfortable, however, because her pose gives the form of a pyramid, producing an effect of stability. She appears almost stonelike due to the monochromatic beige and white palette. Only by subtly varying the tones of pink, yellow, and brown for the flesh did Karfiol suggest that the figure was alive. When Seated Figure was exhibited in 1925-26 at the First Pan-American Exhibition of Oil Paintings in Los Angeles, where it was awarded an honorable mention, it hung next to Parthenope by JOHN CARROLL (LACMA; q.v). The two paintings reflect the interest in classicism prevalent during the decade among artists who wished to synthesize figure painting and modernist abstract concerns. Karfiolâ€™s manipulation of the formal elements of his painting appears less extreme than does Carrollâ€™s.

This view of the interior of the Toledo Cathedral was no doubt painted during that trip. Halpert had originally met Robert Delaunay years before in Brittany, and they remained friends even after Halpertâ€™s return to New York in 1911. Halpert acted as Delaunayâ€™s American representative during the dispute over the installation of Delaunayâ€™s City of Paris, 1910-12 (MusÃ©e national dâ€™Art moderne, Centre national dâ€™Art et de Culture Georges Pompidou, Paris) in the Armory Show. Toledo Cathedral was no doubt inspired by Robert Delaunayâ€™s series on Saint Severin painted in 1909. Both artists shared a fascination with color and light and expressed this interest through the motif of a church interior. Halpert, however, did not become as abstract in his work as did Delaunay, who manipulated the architecture of the Saint Severin church so that its structure became a series of prismatically colored planes in flux. Instead, Halpert used the solid Gothic architectural structure as a frame contrasted to the light and color filling the nave. The sunlight is softened as it enters through the stained glass windows and forms an almost tangible, hazy atmosphere in the church. Color and light constitute the subject of the painting, as the stained-glass windows cause patterns of alternating colors -- violet, yellow, orange, red, and green -- to flicker across the surfaces of the stone columns and floor. The museumâ€™s painting is very similar to another one of Toledo Cathedral done about the same time. The threestory elevation with clerestory depicted in the museumâ€™s version appears to be of the Gothic cathedralâ€™s transept near the crossing, while the other painting with its two-story elevation is of the nave. Although there are more stained glass windows in the cathedralâ€™s nave, both of Halpertâ€™s interpretations are equally concerned with light and color. The differences between the two versions are subtle. In the museumâ€™s painting Halpert positioned himself almost directly in front of the wall of glass and stone rather than on a slightly oblique angle as in the other version. Consequently the piers and arches appear less as a series of abstract, arcing lines and more as clearly defined archways. Both paintings have small figures, differing only in number and placement. According to photographs of the painting published when it was first exhibited in the autumn of 1916, the cathedral interior originally was shown with a plain stone floor. Sometime thereafter, for reasons unknown, Halpert changed the floor and some minor architectural details, such as the balustrade in the far-right triforium window. William Preston Harrison had wanted to purchase a major work by Halpert since 1916, the year of this painting. He was not able to obtain one until 1933, when he traded a dealer paintings by WALTER UFER, Grace Ravlin (born 1885), and WILLIAM WENDT for this painting.', ''),

This seems plausible since Carroll knew both artists from Woodstock. In fact, Bellows was Carrollâ€™s neighbor. The residence of the Ash Can artists prompted Woodstock modernists to become more concerned with realism. Encouraged by Andrew Dasburg, Carroll had experimented with abstraction, creating cubist still-life paintings similar to the arrangement of tulips and sheet music that he incorporated into the composition of Lady in Blue. Carrollâ€™s treatment of the figure as a series of cylinders no doubt was also influenced by the work of CÃ©zanne and of Fernand LÃ©ger (1881-1955) and the other French purists. The compression of space into a series of overlapping planes and an emphasis on curving lines describing the figure, chair, and flowers reflect Carrollâ€™s fascination with abstract line, an interest that critics sometimes thought too decorative. Color is limited to a cool palette of tin blue for the dress and gray for the background. The paintingâ€™s archaic quality is in keeping with the strong interest of some modernists in American folk art during the late 1910s and early 1920s. The figureâ€™s stiff, primitive character may also have been due the fact that it was based on an old photograph, which may also explain the paintingâ€™s monochromatic palette. Lady in Blue is a portrait of William Preston Harrisonâ€™s mother, Sophonisba Grayson Preston (c. 1834-1876), who was descended from the Puritans. Harrison suggested that the painting be titled Lady in Blue to avoid any criticism that might arise if a portrait of one of his relatives were installed in the museum. Regardless of the identity of the figure, the painting is of a type with the other images of single figures painted by Carroll in the 1920s.', ''),

In contrast to the two flappers depicted in Shops, 1922 (LACMA; q.v.), who also stand before a black, wrought-iron fence on a city street, this Oriental brazenly confronts the viewer with her direct gaze and open, frontal pose. Du Bois was a master of modern design. He conceived the Oriental as dark, shadowy, and fully modeled in contrast to the flat, brilliant orange brick wall she stands before and the gleaming white steps nearby. The scene is a slightly asymmetrical arrangement of three simplified areas of color held together by the iron fence. The womanâ€™s head is slightly cropped by the top of the canvas.

Quite unlike those heroic figures are the diminutive silhouettes in the museumâ€™s painting, who very well may represent the summer visitors from the nearby hotels whom Homer and his family are known to have joined on at least one occasion as they watched the moonlit sea on the rocks near Homerâ€™s home and studio at Proutâ€™s Neck, Maine. On that occasion, the artist left the group, completing on the porch of his studio the charcoal drawing that formed the basis of his painting A Summer Night, 1890 (MusÃ©e d''''Orsay, Paris), in which the figure at left in the museumâ€™s painting seems to appear. Like the watercolor A Moonlit Sea, 1890 (Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford), the museumâ€™s painting may be a study for A Summer Night; or it may be an independent work of years earlier, related to the watercolor, Northeaster, dated 1883 (Brooklyn Museum), a daylight scene in which two women in tam-oâ€™-shanter and round bonnet watch the sea from the rocks (although their positions are reversed). It can also be related to the painting Moonlight, Wood Island Light, 1894 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), because of the exceptionally bold technique of both paintings. According to the art historian William Downes, that picture was painted in 1894 during an impulsive four or five hoursâ€™ work one night, entirely by moonlight, a seemingly impossible illumination for judging colors. Because of its exceptionally free technique, the museumâ€™s painting is difficult to date on the basis of style. The connection with the works of 1890 seems most persuasive. For Homer, the moonlit sea was a recurring romantic theme in which the otherwise threatening sea seems tamed and charmed. The violence of the sea in Moonlight on the Water is somewhat unusual within this group.  On the back of the painting the artistâ€™s brother Charles, his executor, indicated the date 1906, a period when Homer was known to have begun no new pictures, only repainting old ones. While there is no evidence of repainting on the pictureâ€™s present surface, it may have been at this time that Homer restretched the painting, greatly changing its proportions by folding portions of the painting back around the stretcher at the top and sides to give it its present, unusually elongated shape. In adopting this format, Homer may have meant to accentuate the characteristics of the painting that relate to the Japanese prints he admired -- the theme of the great wave, diagonal compositional elements, silhouetted figures, and strong surface design.', ''),

Manship originally created the pair of sculptures for his own use, to occupy places at either end of a mantlepiece in his apartment in New York. The antelopeâ€™s side is pierced by the arrow, in low relief, that has just left the Indianâ€™s bow. The release of tension in the bow is answered by the tensing of the animalâ€™s body in pain and surprise; the pair of sculptures relate to each other across distance in terms of sequence and causeand-effect. Formally they offer a contrast between the heavy, stable, and angular body of the Indian and the light, unstable, and curving form of the antelope. Like the antelope and like many of Man, shipâ€™s earlier sculptures, Indian is relatively flat and meant to be viewed principally from one side. The sculptor stated that his primary objective was to create decorative arrangements of form. The strong silhouette allowed him to develop long, elegant contour lines and to achieve contrast and balance of form and space, both within each figure and between the two. While at the American Academy in Rome he had developed a great admiration for the formal qualities of archaic Greek sculpture, as well as Gothic and East Indian sculpture. Although his subject is a Native American, Manship developed it in terms of Greek models in the way the simple, clear form of the manâ€™s body is set off by the areas of stylized, decorative detail in the hair and in the drapery. Although it must be the skin of a wild beast, the flat folds and meandering edge of the drapery emulate Greek examples. The essential quality of Manshipâ€™s sculpture is that it formalizes nature to achieve a pleasing, decorative effect in which rich patterns balance austere purity of outline. Manship was one of the first American sculptors to reject the Rodinesque style of conspicuous modeling, seen in the work of ARTHUR PUTNAM, for example. There are no accidents of modeling in his smooth, compact, very carefully calculated, and exquisitely adjusted forms. The statuette was cast by Roman Bronze Works, New York, in an edition of fifteen (see Murtha, Manship, p. 152, for partial list of locations), and a unique example of heroic size was made in 1917, originally for the garden of Herbert Pratt, Glen Cove, N.Y.', ''),

By leaving parts of the composition in a conspicuously unfinished state, Chase and his American and German associates in Munich drew attention to the forceful realism in the finished portions of the face, and to the fact that the rendering was achieved in just one sitting rather than as a result of two or more sessions. For instance, in subsequent revisions the artist also would have worked in the back, ground light and shadow over the extended portion of the hair, bringing the entire painting to a state of uniform finish. The clarity of vision and economy of means that produced such realistic definition and strong characterization bear witness to the technical brilliance achieved by Chase at the Munich Academy. In 1928 the subject was identified as a violinist and in 1937 as the celebrated virtuoso and composer Pablo de Sarasate (1844-1904), who toured widely during the 1870s. Chaseâ€™s subject seems older than thirty-one, Sarasateâ€™s age in 1875, although the portrait bears a general resemblance to other images of the violinist. In 1875 Sarasate would not have worn the lapel rosette of the Legion of Honor, which may have been added at a later date.  The canvas may have been stored rolled up, causing a multitude of fine, horizontal cracks to appear.

With the encouragement of the sculptor Frederick Wellington Ruckstull (1853-1942), who was then working on an equestrian monument, in the late fall of 1894 Remington set to work on his first sculpture, The Bronco Buster. He took his subject from A Pitching Bronco, one of his illustrations that had been published in the April 30, 1892, issue of Harperâ€™s Weekly. He completed the sculpture by the third week of August 1895. Remingtonâ€™s direction in sculpture was probably inspired by his admiration for the animal bronzes of the great French sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye (1796-1875) and of the bronzes of the numerous French animal sculptors Barye inspired. Remington also had some contact with AUGUSTUS SAINT-GAUDENS, FREDERICK MACMONNIES, the animalier Edward Kemeys (1843-1907), and other leading American sculptors. In the most important respects, however, Remingtonâ€™s bronzes are distinctly his own. Especially characteristic is the almost photographic quality of suspended, violent movement and his interest in freeing the figure from the support of the base so that the work truly seems to be in motion. The Bronco Buster was the most popular of Remingtonâ€™s sculptures and had a long and active casting history. Because of the technical aspects of the sand-casting technique used by the Henry-Bonnard Bronze Company, the approximately seventy casts of the first edition were identical. Around 1900 Remington began to use Roman Bronze Works to cast sculpture. The lost-wax method used by this foundry permitted Remington to modify the model of The Bronco Buster to bring it closer to his evolving objectives. Between 1903 and 1907 he made numerous individual and permanent adjustments both in the plaster model and in the wax models used for each cast to give the sculpture a greater unity and more vivid sense of motion. Remington reached the final, perfected version of the model in 1907, in about cast number sixty, which all subsequent casts resemble. The museumâ€™s cast is number sixty-nine, recorded with nine other numbers in the firmâ€™s ledger on December 31, 1907. Roman Bronze Works cast about 307 examples of the statuette. The foundry also produced approximately twenty-two casts of a larger statue (see National Museum of American Art, Cast and Recast, pp. 92-99 for casting history and ownership of both sizes).', ''),

The brushwork is vigorous and joyous, clearly showing his dashing execution.

Davies (1931), Dr. Virginia M. Davies assigned this painting to 1908. However, this list is not always accurate. Davies rarely dated his paintings himself and did not develop in a linear manner, so the dates of many of his works have never been clearly determined. Pastoral Dells and Peaks relates to Daviesâ€™s experience of the American West. In 1905 he traveled to Colorado, Nevada, Utah, and California and made several oil sketches of the dramatic, high-peaked mountains. After this trip West he abandoned the more domestic, arcadian landscapes of his earlier pastorals in favor of looming, powerful mountain ranges. It was Daviesâ€™s memory of the Sierras and the soaring evergreens that inspired the background composition of Pastoral Dells and Peaks, although the artist simplified the setting, reducing its specificity. Davies was acquainted with ancient art and mythology and had visited southern Italy and Greece in 1897, 1910, and 1911. He often depicted his figures as classically robed shepherds and herders. While this scene probably was not intended to illustrate a specific story, it recalls the myth of Io, a beautiful maiden who was turned into a heifer for being loved by Jupiter. Davies follows the tradition of Greek vase painting by presenting the female figures in a paler color than the male figures. In 1908 the artist began to arrange his figures in dancersâ€™ poses in long, friezelike processions along a shallow foreground in what he referred to as continuous compositions. Pastoral Dells and Peaks does not have as many figures, nor is it as stringently composed along a processional line as Daviesâ€™s more mature paintings from about 1913. Consequently, it may be an early example of Daviesâ€™s continuous composition, perhaps inspired by one of his trips to Greece. So Pastoral Dells and Peaks may date as early as 1908 but probably not later than 1911.', ''),

The impact of postimpressionist and School of Paris paintings exhibited in the Armory Show of 1913 challenged him to modify his approach to painting. Prior to this time he had waited to encounter an interesting subject and then painted it from memory in his studio; now he recognized the validity of landscapes and of more randomly chosen motifs, as well as the need to paint on a regular basis. During his five summers in Gloucester Sloan painted approximately three hundred pictures, most of them done on his portable easel. These outdoor scenes were painted quickly and directly, with very few sketches. Seeing the limitations of his formerly low-key palette, Sloan now employed a much greater variety of color, using for each painting a different, set palette, limited according to the scheme of color advocated by the color theorist and paint supplier Hardesty Maratta. In Town Steps and other works Sloan also explored the theories of architectonic structure advocated by Maratta and others, developing a firm geometry and long diagonals, while also tilting up his backgrounds to better balance surface design with perspective recession. In this painting Sloan displays a new vigor of paint application and interest in painting textures, inspired by his having seen paintings by Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890). According to Sloan the figures in Town Steps were anonymous pedestrians, typical citizens of Gloucester. As is characteristic of his paintings of the area, it is a landscape with figures rather than a genre subject, as were his New York paintings. The original title, The Town Steps, is misleading because of the definite article. There were several sets of stairs between the streets of Gloucester, none singled out as the town steps. Years later, after looking at a reproduction of the painting, Sloan commented, Thoroughly satisfactory is my memory of this painting refreshed by the photograph. These wooden steps were a pedestrian thoroughfare connecting streets on two levels. The girls are healthy types of the native population. Rich in color and convincing in light.

This painting depicts such an excursion, for the model was one of Millerâ€™s students, Dorothea Schwarcz Greenbaum (b. 1893), who would later become a sculptor. As she recalled, Although we would pay homage to Titian and Rubens, most of our time was spent in the gloomy basement, studying the casts of Greek sculpture. He knew every fold in the draperies of the figures from the Parthenon and could draw them from memory. I do not know why he was a painter and not a sculptor-all his teaching led in that direction. Miller filled a large part of the scene with a huge Corinthian capital that vies in importance with the figure. Other classical objects are partially visible, and the model rests her arm on the edge of a Roman sarcophagus. The setting of this painting may be the then newly opened Cloisters of the museum, but Miller did not render the ancient objects literally enough for them to be identified definitely as works in the Metropolitan Museumâ€™s collection. Woman in Sculpture Hall summarizes Millerâ€™s mature art for it demonstrates two of his obsessions: modern woman and antique sculpture. Greenbaum is presented as a typical Miller woman, somewhat chubby, with a round face, large eyes, and full lips, wearing the usual shopper attire -- a fashionable overcoat, beaded necklace, and cloche -- with handbag at her side. The museum setting may have been chosen as a vehicle for Miller to express more openly his respect for classical art. Once Miller adopted the shopper image, he rarely referred to antique motifs, even in his nudes. Instead, he conceived his women as sculpture, painting them fully modeled and like stone works of art. The artist described this paintingâ€™s masses as falling in two columns. Miller also seems to have purposely limited his palette to dull beiges and oranges, alluding to the color of stone.

This sentiment was expressed to Harrison when the collector visited New York on his way to France. Frieseke painted the portrait a few weeks later at his summer home in Le-Mesnil-sur-Blangy. The Harrisons arrived there in late July, and by August 12 Harrison could write to Louise Upton at the museum that the portrait was completed. Harrison was quite satisfied with the finished painting, considering it not only a typical Frieseke but a painting worthy of being in the museum. It combined the best of Friesekeâ€™s talents, being a figure painting to which natural light is essential. Young Carter sits politely on the edge of an elegant French chair, obviously posing for the artist and oblivious to the sunlight filtering into the room through the windows and door. The sunâ€™s intense rays contrast with the soft interior light. The pastel palette used to describe the scene is unlike that of most late works by Frieseke, which are delicate but usually darker. In fact, although Frieseke completed the painting, it appears almost unfinished. Despite the delicate effect, the painting has a strong structure organized by the lines of the room and the placement of the furniture. The variety of decorative patterns within the composition do not confuse the legibility of the scene, and, in fact, the patterned objects -- upholstered chair, oriental rug, and garden flowers in the distance -- form a contrast with the figure of the quiet boy. Harrison entitled the painting Youth rather than identifying it as a portrait of his son to avoid the type of criticism that the portrait of Mrs. Harrison by ROBERT HENRI, 1925 (LACMA; q.v.), had received.', ''),

Great riches were amassed by railroad tycoons and land barons, and along with this came the desire for a luxurious standard of living. Collectors filled their homes with European as well as American works of art. American artists, generally trained abroad, often painted in styles that were indistinguishable from their European counterparts. <BR>Most Americans who studied abroad did so in the European academies, which promoted uplifting subject matter and a representational style that emphasized well-modeled, clearly defined forms and realistic color. Academic painting served American artists well, for their clients demanded elaborate large-scale paintings to demonstrate their wealth and social positions. With an emphasis on material objects and textures, academic artists immortalized their patronsâ€™ importance in full-length portraits. <BR>Academic painting dominated taste in Europe throughout the century. But in the 1860s impressionism emerged in France as a reaction to this hegemony. By the 1880s this â€œnew paintingâ€? was still considered progressive. Mary Cassatt was the only American invited to participate in the revolutionary Paris impressionist exhibitions. Despite her participation and the early interest of several other American painters, few Americans explored impressionism until the 1890s. Impressionist painters no longer had to choose subject matter of an elevated character but instead could depict everyday scenes and incidents. Nor did impressionists have to record the physical world with the objective detail of a photograph. Artists were now encouraged to leave their studios and paint outside under different weather conditions. American impressionists used the new aesthetic to capture the charm and beauty of the countryside and the city as well as the quiet delicacy of domestic interiors.', ''),

During the Civil War he fought gallantly under General Sheridan, rising to the rank of brevet lieutenant-colonel. After being graduated from Columbian College in Washington, D.C., in 1869, he practiced law in Mississippi. Appointed district attorney for Mississippi by President Grant, Wells was the first to successfully prosecute the Ku Klux Klan. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives in the late 1870s. Recognizing his skills, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Wells in 1877 to the position of consul-general to Shanghai, but he remained less than a year. On his way home from China, he and Mrs. Wells visited Los Angeles and, delighted with the climate, resolved to settle there. In 1879 they returned and Wells set up a law office with judge Brunson. Until an illness forced his retirement, he was an active attorney, involved in many notable cases, including several murder trials, which gained him national recognition.  In 1886 Jenks painted two prominent judges -- one was Wellsâ€™s former partner, Brunson -- for the Los Angeles County Bar. Perhaps it was this commission, or their shared Civil War experience, that inspired Wells to order portraits of his first wife and himself from Jenks. Both paintings are three-quarter length and large in scale. Wells, wearing a dark blue business suit, sits confidently in a red velvet upholstered armchair, his left arm propped up by a book. This book, along with others that lie open on the nearby table and in the bookcases on the wall behind him, refer to Wellsâ€™s learned profession. Wells appears exactly as he did in photographs of the period. Given the intensely realistic facial expression and a certain stiffness of pose, Jenks may have relied heavily on a photograph when painting the portrait. The painting is not reproduced here because of its poor condition.  Mrs. Wells, born Katy C. Fox, married Guilford Wells in Avoca, New York, her birthplace, on December 22, 1864. She bore him one child, a son, who died at an early age.  Katy Wells is elegantly dressed in the height of mid-1880s fashion, befitting her social position. She wears a white satin gown trimmed in Battenberg lace and holds a carved wooden fan in her left hand. Her frizzed hair is braided in a chignon.

Hassam began traveling to the West Coast in the early years of this century, first to spend time with a patron in Oregon. Later he visited California several times. Hassam definitely visited the San Francisco area in 1914, to complete a lunette mural for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition of 1915. While in San Francisco he stayed at the Bohemian Club but made excursions to the favorite painting spots of local artists in the neighboring areas, among them Carmel.  Point Lobos, Carmel was the result of a sketching trip that Hassam took with the California landscape painter Francis J. McComas (1874-1938). McComasâ€™s second wife recounted to Kent Seavey the amusing story of how McComas became upset by Hassam when he insisted on turning his back upon a beautiful view of the coast to paint the scene from memory.  Hassamâ€™s painting method may account for the similarities between this Carmel view and his coastal scenes of Maine. Carmel was a favorite painting locale for artists, but Hassam may have found it especially attractive because it reminded him of his beloved Appledore in New England. Northern California shares with Maine a rugged coastline, and Hassam seems to have approached both shores in similar terms. He focused on the weather-hewn boulders, constructing them with the same forceful, short, vertical and diagonal brushstrokes and rich, contrasting, dark and light hues that appear in his Maine paintings. Only the cypress, bent from the ceaseless pounding of the ocean winds, alludes to a western locale.  When a group of Hassamâ€™s California landscapes was exhibited in the winter of 1915-16, they were considered striking and generally praised for their remarkable effects of filtered sunlight (American Art News 14 [December 4, 1915]: 5).

The most modernist works Seyffert was ever to produce, these canvases were no doubt influenced by the nude studies painted by his friend Arthur B. Caries. Both men used the same model, beautiful red-haired Grace Vernon, better known as Bobby, who would later become Seyffertâ€™s second wife. In several paintings Seyffert placed Bobby in highly decorative interiors with an ornate oriental screen, panel, or drape as a backdrop. Her body was treated as a single form and her extremities generalized or attenuated. In The Lacquer Screen, 1918 (Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia), the curves of the nude echo the calligraphic lines in the Chinese coromandel screen behind her, but in Nude with Chinese Background the figure is more abstracted, her linear body contrasting with the curving lines depicting the lohans (enlightened disciples of the Buddha) on the background panel. By stylizing the figure and using a creamy ivory, Seyffert accentuated the womanâ€™s sensuous flesh. She appears almost luminous, the shadows on her skin colored by softer tints of the deep burgundy and green in the drapery and the earth-colored panel that surround her. The painting was altered by the artist after it was first exhibited. When shown at the Pennsylvania Academy annual in 1919, it was entitled Silver Screen, after the burnished silver screen behind the figure. Seyffert decided to repaint the background in about 1920, incorporating a much more elaborate panel, somewhat like the one in The Lacquer Screen. He painted the background in large, sweeping strokes, and the lohans seem to take on a life of their own.

The critic Royal Cortissoz referred to these paintings as the window series, since the figure either sits or stands in front of or next to a window through which sunlight streams into a room. Often the window provides an unobstructed view of the city, but occasionally, as here, a drapery filters the light or even obstructs the view. Usually little of the room is shown, except for a highly polished table, which reflects the sunlight, and upon which is set a delicate vase of fresh flowers, a tea set, platter of fruit, or an objet dâ€™art. The woman is never very active but instead is engrossed in a book, thoughtful contemplation, or quiet examination of an object. Often, as in this painting and Tanagra, 1918 (National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.), the woman is dressed in a loose fitting costume. Tanagra is the window-series painting most closely related to Strawberry Tea Set, sharing the similarity of the womanâ€™s costume, the horizontal composition, and the womanâ€™s fascination with an object that she holds in her hand. In these paintings Hassam came close to the studio productions of the Boston school painters and their depictions of upper-class women living comfortably in their elegant houses. Hassam differed from them in his emphasis on mood, which he conveyed through the figureâ€™s introspective attitude and evocative lighting.  In his delineation of form Hassam was more conservative in the window series than in his flag paintings of the same period. This is especially true of Strawberry Tea Set, where the figure is slightly larger than in most of the other window paintings. Hassam rendered her as quite solid by modeling the form with heavy brushstrokes and manipulating the filtered light. Much less conservative was the palette, as Hassam daringly carried out the composition in a brilliant bluish green, ocher, an electric purple for highlights, and a pure white.', ''),

His heads of two sisters, Florence Gibbs and Belle Gibbs, 1872 (Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Tex.), were significant early efforts at portraiture, which was to remain an important part of the sculptorâ€™s work throughout his career. As a young sculptor working in Rome in the early 1870s Saint-Gaudens depended on the patronage of Americans visiting the city. Montgomery Gibbs, father of Belle and Florence, a successful New York lawyer and writer, visited Saint-Gaudensâ€™s studio in January 1872 to order a cameo for his wife. He was so impressed by Saint-Gaudensâ€™s work that on a second visit to the studio, when he met the ailing sculptor, he offered him several commissions. Gibbs was Saint-Gaudensâ€™s first major patron and extended the struggling young artist financial support at a critical time in his career. While the family was in Rome, Saint, Gaudens began the busts of Belle and Florence that Montgomery Gibbs commissioned as part of his agreement to support the sculptor. He needed photographs to complete the likenesses, however; Gibbs wrote from Naples in February that Florence had been too busy to have her photograph taken but that Belle was then at the photographerâ€™s studio. In April Florence wrote from Venice that she had not yet had the photograph taken but would have it done when the family was in Vienna. In a letter of May 1872 to Montgomery Gibbs, Saint-Gaudens wrote of the busts: Miss Belleâ€™s bust will be finished in two or three days and I am highly satisfied. I cannot say the same though of Miss Florenceâ€™s bust. It has been quite unfortunate. After having the rest of the bust roughed out and commencing to work on the features, a spot in the marble appeared over the left eye, so of course cutting could not go on. I have been obliged to buy another piece, this time not so cheaply. It cost fifty francs. I have had it commenced immediately and now I am sure we shall not be so unfortunate. The misfortune takes back the economies I had made on the first two pieces, because to the sum must be added the forty francs for what work the buffator had done on it. This of course makes it impossible to have it finished for my [proposed] departure [in July]. The features will be finished, but the hair and the accessories will take some time after my departure.  In a letter to the father on July 18, 1872, he reported on the progress of the busts: Miss Belleâ€™s portrait has also been even a greater success than I expected on the marble. The marble on Miss Florenceâ€™s is one of the finest pieces I have yet met with and if the accessories come out as well as Miss Belleâ€™s-and there is no reason for the contrary-it will be finer, if anything than Miss Belleâ€™s. There were additional delays before the Gibbs family received the finished busts, but a letter from Florence Gibbs in September 1874 reports the familyâ€™s satisfaction with both.  Despite Saint-Gaudensâ€™s expressed satisfaction with the marble, it should be noted that compared with the flawless marble Hiram Powers (1805-1873) and other neoclassical sculptors insisted upon, the marble in the bust of Florence Gibbs is less than perfect, with some soft rust-colored areas, veins of pure white in the warmer stone, and one open crack on the right shoulder.  The bust came to the museum identified as Belle Gibbs, but a letter to Saint-Gaudens from Florence Gibbs in April 1872 refers to the locket: I forgot to give you the heart locket to copy, but perhaps you remember it, indicating that Florence is the subject of the museumâ€™s bust.  Saint-Gaudens recalled the sisters as both young and attractive and also recalled having a soft spot for Florence. Mrs. Thomas Ridgeway Gould, wife of the sculptor and a host to Americans in Rome, noted Saint-Gaudensâ€™s interest in the younger sister, although she felt Florence was coquettish. In one of her several letters to Saint-Gaudens, Florence wrote, You are bound that my features, including the purely Grecian nose shall go down to posterity in correct shape. The sculptor saw the girls socially on several occasions when they were in Rome. Some association may have continued afterward, to judge from the fact that Belle, then Mrs. John Merrylees, sent the sculptor an announcement of the marriage of her daughter in 1905. Nothing is known of the later life of Florence.  The busts were conceived as a pair and are very similar in format and attire but not in interpretation. Belleâ€™s (see illustration) is a more animated likeness. She looks forward with her lips slightly parted in a slight smile, whereas Florence turns slightly to the right and looks to the right and has a quieter, more thoughtful expression. Although executed in white marble, they are not neoclassical in feeling. Their naturalism and strong sense of personality recall the French portrait sculpture of the late eighteenth century, especially that of Jean-Antoine Houdon (1741-1828), as well as the work of contemporary French sculptors working in a rococo style. Specific stylistic features of Florence Gibbs may have been derived from the work of Houdon, particularly the hollow carving of the pupils, the line of lace edging that vaguely resembles the loose drapery of Houdon, and especially the turning of the head and the glance away that in the work of Houdon suggest an animated but elusive personality glimpsed in an unguarded moment.', ''),

As part of the Fourth Liberty Loan Drive, New Yorkâ€™s Fifth Avenue was transformed into an art gallery during October 1918. Paintings devoted to the different Allied nations were displayed in shop windows. During this period Luks was inspired to paint a series of war-related compositions. The Czechoslovakian march through Siberia and the Czechoslovakian drive for independence during the war were causes cÃ©lÃ¨bres that were repeatedly headlined in the newspapers. During the war Czech troops joined the Russians to fight on the side of the Allies. With the withdrawal of Russia from fighting after the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litowsk in 1918, the Czechs were forced to leave Russia. They marched through Siberia and despite many impediments caused by poor weather and adverse political conditions reached Vladivostok in May 1918. There they boarded ships to journey to France, where they were to join other Allied forces. Luks depicted these soldiers arriving in Vladivostok. Luks no doubt became involved in the Czech cause through his friendship with the sculptor Gutzon Borglum (1871-1941), who had became closely involved in the Czech cause and even permitted his home in Stamford, Connecticut, to be used as a military base for the training of American-born Czech volunteers. Luks visited Borglum during this time and once joined him in painting posters to raise funds for the camp. Although Luks did not see the Czech army advancing in Siberia, he may have observed new soldiers practicing marching and attacking. He depicted the camp in Connecticut at least once, in Czechoslovakians in American Camp Celebrating Their Recognition as a Country, 1918 (unlocated; exhibited Allied War Salon, American Art Association Galleries, New York, 1918). Such an experience enabled Luks to become familiar with the Czech uniforms as depicted in Czech-slovak Chieftain, 1919 (Newark [N.J.] Museum), and also the new countryâ€™s flag. Although the red-andwhite striped flag Luks delineated in the museumâ€™s painting is not the design eventually selected for the national flag, it is the one depicted by Henry Rittenberg (1879-1969) in his painting of the Czech army that was carried down Fifth Avenue during the celebrations in October 1918. This is the only major war scene Luks painted that he could not have witnessed firsthand. He based his painting on a photograph and description of the actual event told to him by a Lieutenant Frank Danielovsky. Danielovsky was one of the select dignitaries asked to participate in the Czechoslovak Day celebrations along Fifth Avenue on October 3, 1918. Luks inscribed in the lower-left corner of the painting that Danielovsky was his source, but at some unknown time the inscription was painted over. Although Luks could have painted Czechoslovakian Army Entering Vladivostok, Siberia, in 1918 as early as May, he may have painted it as late as October, after the Czech Day celebrations of the Fourth Liberty Loan Drive. It certainly was finished by the time of the Allied War Salon in December. In his usual bold brushwork Luks depicted the long column of Czech soldiers marching behind their leader on a cold winter day. The scene is simple, reduced to a central horizontal band of figures on a slight diagonal, with the background consisting of a few buildings. The composition of the scene relates to Luksâ€™s other war paintings of marching figures, The Blue Devils on Fifth Avenue, 1917 (Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C.), and The Bersaglieri, 1918 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.). The overall impression is less agitated, however, due to the larger and broader areas of color.

In his most important canvases of this decade, such as Landscape with Figures, he depicted a peasant mother with a child and goats or other farm animals walking through a forest glade. Costigan used his wife, Ida Blessin (b. 1894), an accomplished sculptress, and their five children as models. Despite financial problems, which must have made life on the farm difficult, Costigan idealized rural life, conveying in his pictures a quiet, pastoral peacefulness. Removed from nearby New York City, Orangeburg became Costiganâ€™s Barbizon. Despite the calm, soothing quality of his subjects, Costiganâ€™s paintings of the 1920s were alive with energy, created by his almost incessant movement of pigment and flickering color. Landscape with Figures is a superb example of Costiganâ€™s work with its heavily encrusted surfaces, at times almost one-eighth inch thick. With a palette knife and the fullest of brushes he created impastoed passages that appear to be woven skeins of dripped pigment. His palette is equally charged: flecks of brilliant white, red, orange, magenta, yellow, green, dark blue, and brown emerge from a generally pale blue tonality. While the overall palette of Landscape with Figures is slightly sweeter than usual for this period, his paintings of the 1920s always glow with a variety of intense, warm hues. Costiganâ€™s treatment is a late and extreme manifestation of American impressionism, characterized not only by a decorative quality but by a vigor of paint and light. This flickering of light and paint suggests an atmosphere alive with the movement and spirit of nature. The source for this transcendental mood-as well as a decorative quality-may have been one of Costiganâ€™s favorite paintings, The Hermit, 1908, by JOHN S. SARGENT, which Costigan often studied at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Both artists presented alandscape in which rich foliage and sunlight animate the scene and make it difficult to distinguish the figures from their setting. The figures literally as well as metaphorically become one with nature.', ''),

Theirs was the story of a poor girl marrying a rich man, and possibly because of this circumstance the couple eventually moved to Los Angeles. They had one child, Carter Preston. Henri was supposed to paint the portrait in the summer of 1924, at the same time that WAYMAN ADAMS was originally scheduled to paint Mr. Harrisonâ€™s portrait, but Henriâ€™s trip to Los Angeles was delayed until February of the following year. The artist was never very anxious to accept portrait commissions and viewed them mainly as a source of income. Because Harrison had been a strong supporter of his art, he probably felt he could not refuse the commission. Henriâ€™s sentiment notwith-standing, the portrait is a good example of the artistâ€™s late style. Instead of the thick, robust paint surface of his earlier paintings, this portrait has a thinner and flatter appearance. Henriâ€™s portrayal of Ada Harrison is somewhat conservative, probably due to her social prominence and to the fact that the work was intended to hang in the museum next to Adamsâ€™s portrait of her husband. Mrs. Harrison was a large woman, and although Henri did not falsify this aspect of her appearance, he did give her an air of dignity. He minimized Mrs. Harrisonâ€™s bulk somewhat by showing her in a black dress partially covered by a furtrimmed, deep orange wrap. She holds a large, feathered fan. In his early paintings of dancers Henri often included such fans. The fan does not contradict the image of Mrs. Harrisonâ€™s respectability but does add an important color note to this basically dark painting. Harrison noted in 1935 that his wife had become the victim of endless criticism because of the portrait. He felt that much of it was due to other womenâ€™s jealousy over its being in a public museum and regretted not having had the sitterâ€™s identity remain anonymous. Harrison was dismayed with this problem partly because he viewed the painting as a superb example of Henriâ€™s art rather than primarily as a portrait of his wife.', ''),

Parthenope served as a vehicle for the artistâ€™s exploration of progressive ideas. Indeed, it was the paintingâ€™s modern character that attracted attention when it was exhibited at the Los Angeles Museum in the First Pan-American Exhibition of Oil Paintings in 1925-26. At that time controversy arose over whether the coveted Balch prize should be given to a conservative or a modern painting. The result was a compromise, with the award being shared between Where Natureâ€™s God Hath Wrought, 1925 (LACMA; q.v.), by WILLIAM WENDT and Parthenope. Consequently Carrollâ€™s painting received much attention from the press. Most critics appreciated his harmonious color and fluid line. Antony Anderson of the Los Angeles Times wrote, never was rhythm of line and form more alluringly rendered, and Vennerstrom Cannon of the La Jolla Journal thought it remarkable and worth the excursion to Los Angeles. Others could not comprehend Carrollâ€™s modernism, one critic referring to his haulking maidens set against sausage-like hills. It was even parodied in comic versions created for the annual fakir celebration of the California Art Club. E. Roscoe Shrader referred to his version which also appeared as a cartoon in a local newspaperas Bare â€™nâ€™ Soapy, portraying the maidens as women taking a shower and attaching an actual shower nozzle and soap dish to the canvas. Parthenope exemplifies certain aesthetic and pseudoscientific ideas held by progressive artists during the period. Carrollâ€™s tendency to simplify his figures into solid geometric shapes recalls similar neoclassical figures painted in the 1920s by the purists and Pablo Picasso (1881-1973). Since Carroll usually focused on a single figure, he may have felt the need for a theoretical basis for the design of this, his most complex figure composition. To assure a wellproportioned and harmonious arrangement, Carroll constructed the composition on the design principles of the whirling square rectangle as propounded by Jay Hambidge (1867-1924) and his disciple George Bellows. The arrangement of figures across the foreground plane and the placement of their arms and headsespecially those of the woman at center with tilted head and shoulders-accords precisely with Hambidgeâ€™s theory, in particular his emphasis on diagonals to create controlled, rhythmic movement. The arcing lines of the softly rolling, distant mountains repeat the curves and rhythms of the figuresâ€™ anatomy and drapery. Such a treatment of the landscape, although idealized, is similar to that in Bellowsâ€™s Woodstock landscape with figures, Picnic, 1924 (Peabody Institute of the City of Baltimore), which also was based on Hambidgeâ€™s theory of dynamic symmetry. Hambidgeâ€™s concept was founded on principles expounded by the ancient Greeks, and this classical origin may have encouraged Carrollâ€™s use of a classical motif. There are several legends about Parthenope, in one of which she is a siren who, with her sisters, threw herself into the sea, which many have been Carrollâ€™s inspiration. Such an allusion to antiquity and the idealized presentation were not typical of Carrollâ€™s art. Antony Anderson referred to the paintingâ€™s synchronism [sic] of color, and its rainbow effect suggests that Carroll may have applied to Parthenope some of the pseudoscientific color theories then popular. The drape of each of the three foreground figures is painted a single intense hue-red, blue, or green-and these colors as well as the yellow in the middle distance constitute the paintingâ€™s palette. Carroll merely added white to create pastel tints for the background and skin. Even the short, striated brushwork in the background suggests that he sought to present his colors as if seen through a prism.', ''),

He was also an important collector of French art. Son of Carter H. Harrison, five-time mayor of Chicago, and brother of Carter Harrison, also a Chicago mayor, Preston Harrison came to Los Angeles in 1918 after having been involved in the familyâ€™s real estate ventures and serving as editor and publisher of the Chicago Times. He settled in Los Angeles with his wife, Ada Sanberg Harrison (see entry under ROBERT HENRI), and although he lived on the West Coast until his death, he maintained close ties with the Midwest. As did his brother in Chicago, Preston Harrison became involved in local cultural affairs: he served on the board of governors of the Los Angeles Museum (at the time of his death he was vice-president of the board) and was active in the Los Angeles Art Association and the Friends of Art of the Huntington Library. From its inception this portrait was intended for presentation to the museum, and it hung in the Harrison Room along with other paintings donated by the Harrisons. The portrait was painted in New York in June 1924. Typical of Adamsâ€™s painting method, it was completed in one day. Adams delineated the figure with long, sure strokes and the background with equally broad brushwork. Such rapid execution is characteristic of a student of Chase and Henri, and Henri may have suggested to Harrison that Adams be the one to paint his portrait. Adams portrayed Harrison with dignity, befitting his station. Harrisonâ€™s importance as a major patron of the arts is alluded to by the inclusion of a portrait of a crowned figure hanging on the wall behind him. Harrison wears a dark blue business suit and in his hands are a pair of gloves, a cane, and a hat. Every aspect of the painting evokes respectability and decorum. Adams was a master of facial characterization, and he presented Harrison as a generous, elderly man. Although admired by artists, the portrait received some criticism locally. The attacks by Los Angeles society were probably due mostly to jealousy over the portraitâ€™s installation in a public museum, but even Harrison thought that the painting might be called Old Grouchy.', ''),

In many respects it is entirely characteristic of Wendtâ€™s mature paintings: in its subject being the California foothills, its restrained palette, its noon light, its broad, long, regular brushstrokes, and its simplification of forms. Wendtâ€™s approach to composition was to find a motif and let it dictate the structure of the composition. His paintings generally give the impression of an intimate encounter with a modest portion of a landscape and are not formally composed. Where Natureâ€™s God Hath Wrought, in contrast, is an extremely bold and powerful composition, at once dramatic and unified. Wendt always sought the spirit of the landscape and its deeper meaning; the title of this painting is his strongest statement of that philosophy. Many have remarked on the inspirational quality of the mountainâ€™s upward thrust. According to critic Arthur Millier, the view is of Morro Bay, north of San Luis Obispo in central California, where Wendt occasionally worked in the 1920s. As Millier noted, the bayâ€™s distinctive soaring hill formations afforded Wendt a supreme opportunity to express his profound feeling for the structural balance. The last digit of the date Wendt inscribed on the canvas is ambiguous. In recent literature the date given has been 1923, but exhibition and literature references suggest that the artist painted Where Natureâ€™s God Hath Wrought in 1925 or shortly before. The first record of the painting is its inclusion in the Los Angeles Museumâ€™s First Pan-American Exhibition of Oil Paintings of 1925-26. It is doubtful that Wendt would have contributed a painting several years old to such a significant exhibition. Furthermore, the fact that the canvas is unusually large for Wendt might be explained by its function as a major showpiece. The painting shared, with the modernist Parthenope by JOHN CARROLL (LACMA; q.v.), the Balch Prize in the Pan-American Exhibition, achieving for the artist considerable local distinction. It was the one exception to the awards juryâ€™s preference for progressive styles. This may be explained, in part, by a deference to Wendtâ€™s preeminence among Los Angeles artists. At the same time, however, the paintingâ€™s breadth and simplified, somewhat geometric forms would have appealed to the taste of the jurors.', ''),

The head of the sculpture is somewhat foxlike because of the size of the ears in relation to the width of the rostrum, but the length and thickness of the legs, the stance, the size and position of the tail, and the heaviness of the body are all characteristic of the coyote and not of the fox. Putnamâ€™s intimate knowledge of the animals is sometimes obscured in his smaller bronzes, which were more freely and expressively modeled than many of the larger ones.

Balch Collection (M.45.3.526)', 'In the Boudoir is typical of the many informal interior scenes Frieseke painted throughout his career. Although he much preferred to paint outdoors, the American public of the 1910s more readily bought his boudoir scenes of women involved in their toilette or in some other feminine activity. The artistâ€™s wife, Sarah, better known as Sadie, usually posed as his model in their home. In this painting, as in many of Friesekeâ€™s interiors of the 1910s, the model lounges in a room decorated with elegant French rococo furniture and an oriental carpet. In contrast to the figureâ€™s restful pose, the scene is alive with decorative patterning. Friesekeâ€™s interior is similar to those by Edouard Vuillard (18681940). Both artists often presented their figures in corners of rooms, viewing them diagonally and from a slightly elevated viewpoint. The floor tilts up, flattening the space of the room and thereby emphasizing the painting as an arrangement of flat shapes and patterns. Frieseke differed from Vuillard in his tendency to present his models more intimately attired or involved in more personal activities. In Torn Lingerie, 1915 (Saint Louis Art Museum), the model reveals her lovely leg while mending her slip, and in In the Boudoir she abandons her sewing basket to stretch out comfortably on the settee, allowing her kimono to slip off and expose her shoulders and breast. The palette of Friesekeâ€™s interiors from his middle period varies in brilliance, some being as intense as his sunlit garden views. In the Boudoir is, in fact, one of his more delicate interiors of the mid-1910s: soft pastel blues, lavenders, and yellows predominate, and a silvery white is pervasive. There exists a smaller, almost exact version of In the Boudoir painted in a stronger palette (see Related Work). Frieseke occasionally painted smaller versions of completed paintings he admired. It is not known if the smaller version of this composition is such a replica or a study for the larger painting. When the painting was exhibited at the Anglo-American Exposition in London in 1914, it was praised for its subtlety and found more satisfactory than Friesekeâ€™s other exhibit, The Garden Umbrella, n.d. (Telfair Academy of Arts and Sciences, Savannah, Ga.). According to a letter from the New York dealer Robert Macbeth to Frieseke, In the Boudoir was bought out of the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, where it won the grand prize. Mr. and Mrs. Baich, the collectors who donated the painting to the museum, began acquiring art in the mid-1910s and were known to purchase works from San Francsico dealers. Although it cannot be verified, it is quite plausible that the Balches may have bought In the Boudoir in 1915.', ''),

When the plaster models of the two small pieces were exhibited at the 1903-4 winter exhibition of the American Art Association in Paris, they were enthusiastically noted by the press. This critical attention launched Youngâ€™s career. According to the artist Tired Out was modeled from memory and from small life drawings. It may have been first conceived as part of a larger project, since the figure appears as the top center component in the drawing Monument to Labor, c. 19023 (Provo, Utah, Harris Fine Arts Center, Brigham Young University). Youngâ€™s allegorical design was no doubt inspired by the Gates of Hell, begun 1880, by Auguste Rodin (1840-1917); also, the pose of Tired Out was most likely derived from The Thinker, the main figure of Rodinâ€™s Gates. Young transformed Rodinâ€™s contemplative into a man of physical endeavor. The change is most evident in the context of Youngâ€™s allegorical design, which is devoted to the theme of labor. As both Tired Out and Laborer appeared in Monument to Labor (the latter as the large, lower-central motif) and were first exhibited together, Young no doubt originally conceived of them as companion pieces. In fact, when they were reproduced in 1904 in the New York Herald (Paris edition) and the Salt Lake Tribune, the figures were given the titles Toil and Rest. The surface of Tired Out ripples softly throughout, giving an amorphous feeling to the solid mass. Youngâ€™s sketchy handling was probably inspired by Rodin. The toiler is dressed in rough, loose, work clothes, his strength conveyed by his oversized hands. Exhausted, and perhaps asleep, his head and shoulders droop down toward his knees. Although at rest, he conveys a power comparable with that of Youngâ€™s active laborers, who strain under their physical exertion. Despite its small size, the figure is monumental in conception. Youngâ€™s practice was to cast only one bronze at first and later to cast two or three at a time if needed. Although the sculpture was extensively exhibited in the United States during the first two decades of the century after its showing in the Paris Salon of 1904, the museumâ€™s cast is the only located bronze example of Tired Out. It was cast in Paris, probably sometime between the successful exhibition of the plaster model and Youngâ€™s permanent return to the United States in 1905. The casting was done by A. A. HÃ©brard, a small foundry specializing in the lost-wax technique active around 1900. The bronze was originally named Tired Out. When the son of Youngâ€™s friend Al Wright called it man tired, the artist decided that the new title better expressed the sentiment he intended.', ''),

At Dr. Hewettâ€™s invitation Henri spent the summers of 1916, 1917, and 1922 in Santa Fe, where Hewett introduced him to the Native Americans and their cultures. Henriâ€™s ethnological interest in them fits into the larger pattern of his traveling in search of national or ethnic types, such as his Irish, Chinese, and black subjects. In his paintings of Native Americans he paid attention to costumes and daily habits while attempting to convey the spirit of the people, which he saw as noble and mysterious. For this purpose he preferred to paint children rather than adults, saying in The Art Spirit, I have never respected any man more than I have some children. In the faces of children I have seen a look of wisdom and of kindness expressed with such ease and such certainty that I knew it was the expression of a whole race (p. 242).

Several of Henriâ€™s paintings of Native Americans include geometric blankets as backgrounds, perhaps reflecting his growing consciousness of abstract art and surface structure.

Henri advised in The Art Spirit: If there are objects in the background, they must not be painted because they are interesting in themselves.

The monumental double staircase with more than 130 steps was built in 1725 by the French on land owned by them. The stairs lead up a steep hill from a plaza to San TrinitÃ  dei Monti, which had been constructed earlier by Charles viii of France. Such throngs of people immediately flocked to see the stairs that guards from the nearby Spanish embassy were sent to keep order. While the French protested the Spanish intrusion onto their land, the Roman authorities ruled that the stairs fell under the jurisdiction of the Spanish. The public then began referring to the staircase as the Spanish Stairs.  Hassam, painted the stairs during his trip to Europe in 1896-98, when he spent the month of January 1897 in Rome. As so many Americans before him, Hassam became entranced by this scenic spot in the Holy City, and he is known to have painted it at least three times. A comparison of this version with the one in the Newark Museum, of the same size, reveals a change in the artistâ€™s perception of the subject: in the museumâ€™s version Hassam viewed the staircase as a tourist image, presenting an expansive view of the stairs and church above while in the Newark version he moved closer to the scene, thereby eliminating the church and the full sweep of the grand staircase.  In true impressionist fashion, Hassam may have used the motif of the Spanish Stairs to explore the effect of natural light during different times of the day. The Newark version has the brilliant color and intensity of a noonday sun, while the museumâ€™s painting has a more delicate, opalescent palette, suggesting the faint light at the onset of twilight. The hues subtly change from the warm orange of the light of the setting sun caught by the top of the church in the upper right corner of the painting to cooler tones of blue and lavender proceeding down the stairs. The indistinctness of the figures also suggests the crepuscular light of late afternoon. Hassam exhibited a painting titled Le Soir Piazza de Spagna (Rome) at the 1897 Salon of the SociÃ©tÃ© National des Beaux Arts, and the museumâ€™s version, which has on its verso part of a French label dating from the 1890s, may be this evening scene.', ''),

During his lifetime Vysekal became best known for multifigured compositions evidencing his early academic training. He had an excellent command of anatomy and depicted his characters brimming with life, their physiques healthy and robust. In The Herwigs he moved further from his training. Although Vysekal depicted fellow artist William K. Von Herwig (b. 1901) and his family, the figures were only a means to exercise his interest in color abstraction. This becomes more apparent when the unusual presentation of the figures is considered: the mother sits inside on a window seat playing with the child while the father looks on from outside, his hands pressed against the window. The figures form a contemporary Holy Family: the placement of the father outside the house accords with the not uncommon practice of depicting Saint Joseph slightly apart from the Virgin and Child. The family is encircled by the Hollywood Hills, which the artist has transformed into a bright background of color and light. The childâ€™s gesture of stretching upward leads the viewerâ€™s eye toward the prismatic glass wind chime, which recalls the coloristic and formal experiments of modernist artists. As early as 1916 Vysekal became fascinated by the abstract quality of color, and by 1921 this was reflected in the titles of many of his now lost paintings, such as Mlle R.: Arrangement in Green; Brickyard: Violet Major; and Arrangement: Scale of Orange. Color theories were popular among artists during the early twentieth century, and Vysekal may have been first introduced to them at the presentation of the Armory Show in Chicago. The art and teaching of STANTON MACDONALD-WRIGHT in Los Angeles during the 1920s no doubt encouraged Vysekal to apply color theory to his solidly rendered figure studies. In a warm palette of oranges and yellows Vysekal constructed the figures of the Herwigs with flickering planes of light and dark. While he did not completely relinquish modeling of the figure, he was more daring in his treatment of the background, abstracting the landscape into arcing color bands. Moreover, the use of a screen between the figures enabled him to play with the refraction of color and light. The brilliant light almost dissolves the forms while creating a halo effect. Arthur Millier described the glowing color as spiritualizing the paintingâ€™s conception.', ''),

Whittredge may have first visited the area as early as 1859, immediately following his return to America. He visited it often and even built a summer house there. He became fascinated with the colonial architecture of the area, drawing and painting Bishop George Berkeleyâ€™s house, Whitehall. Whittredgeâ€™s first Newport painting dates from 1865, and in the early 1870s he began a series of Newport landscapes in which the focus was a shingled, gambrel-roofed farmhouse near the sea. In most of these landscapes, such as Home by the Sea, c. 1872 (Westmoreland County Museum of Art, Greensburg, Pennsylvania), and Old Homestead by the Sea, 1883 (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), the artist assumed an elevated position away from the house to obtain an expansive view of the surrounding countryside and distant ocean. A Home by the Seaside is the only painting in this series in which Whittredge moved closer to the house, which serves as a framing device leading the viewer into the scene and down the hill to the field below where men are working. The image of hayers was a popular motif, frequently used by Whittredge and other artists of the period to convey the nationalistic pride of a country rich in natural resources and human energy. Although Whittredge explained his attraction to Newport as returning to the land of his forefathers, a land made familiar to him through tales heard as a child, his fascination was also part of a general cultural trend during the late nineteenth century called the colonial revival. The farmhouse in A Home by the Seaside has not been specifically identified, but its type and age added a note of native picturesqueness to the scene. Whittredge did not depict Newport as the fashionable summer resort of the elite but as the land he had heard about as a child. The soft autumnal haze contributes to the general sentiment of nostalgia. By the 1870s Whittredge had become known for his serene, sun-filled, open landscapes. When this painting was exhibited, such critics as George Sheldon praised its diffused light and quiet mood.', ''),

Rothman (47.21.1)', 'Around 1928 Hiler began to omit the figures from his urban views and focus on the cityâ€™s buildings as cubic forms and geometric planes. Eventually, as in Factories at Lyon, he also combined flatly painted surfaces with highly impastoed, striated areas. The textured areas often took on a life of their own, divorced from the overall scene, thereby destroying an already limited sense of painted reality. When Hiler included an occasional figure, he often presented it as a silhouette, as he did here, thereby enhancing the mysterious mood of the scene. Formally, the emphasis on textures relates to synthetic cubism while the flat, planar emphasis of the painting bears a resemblance to some of the precisionist images painted in New York in the 1920s. Not surprisingly, Hiler was a close friend of the artist Niles Spencer (1893-1952). They met in New York around 1917, and when both lived in Paris during the early 1920s they spent many hours discussing artistic issues of subject matter and geometry. However, Hilerâ€™s own abstracted paintings demonstrate a concept invented by him, which Ezra Pound dubbed neonaturism. As the artist explained in his book Why Abstract?, neonaturism was his attempt to combine design with representation, something which he thought was essential. Hiler felt that for a painting to be successful it had to demonstrate the physiological appeal satisfying to manâ€™s geometrical instinct through the use of strictly mathematical composition (Hilerâ€™s Neo-Naturism in Philadelphia Show, Art Digest 8 [November 1, 1933]: 14). The painting is inscribed with the name Cagnes, which may refer to the coastal town near Nice on the French Riviera where Hiler lived occasionally during the early 1930s, although the scene has none of the spirit of the resort town. Rather, by his emphasis on geometric, industrial imagery and use of a dark, dingy palette of brown, gray, and black, Hiler captured the spirit of Lyon, which in 1930 was one of the largest cities in France and a major chemical and engineering center.', ''),

His concern did not end with the Allied victory. In July 1946 he wrote to Herman Baron of the A.C.A. Gallery, What with the Bikini fiasco and OPA [Office of Price Administration] this has been a pretty unsteading [sic] week (Archiv. Am. Art, American Contemporary Artists Gallery Papers, microfilm roll D304, ft 58). During 1946 and 1947 he created images such as New Death, 1947 (Terry Dintenfass, New York), which conveyed his anxiety about the new atomic age. Everybody Wants to Live, probably painted in the winter of 1946-47, demonstrates his skepticism over the ability of the victors to ensure a safe world. He depicted a narrow city street, typical of the area where he lived in lower Manhattan. During 1946 the house in which he lived was the scene of a murder and drug dealings, events that heightened his general state of anxiety. In the painting the pedestriansâ€™ attention is drawn toward the fantastic objects floating in the sky. The image of a sky chaotically filled with strange objects or birds was typical of Evergoodâ€™s postwar paintings. The appearance of the colorful, striped flying machines at first seems innocent enough; their shape, however, recalls the airships that crowded the skies of Europe during the war. The other floating objects resemble underwater mines. The onlookersâ€™ expressions range from wonder and excitement to apprehension, suggesting that the ordinary citizen did not fully comprehend the ramifications of these war machines. Another ominous note to this bizarre scene is the sinister presence of the fat twins in the foreground, whose hats and cloaks may be military uniforms. Evergood realized the expressive potential of color and manipulated it to the fullest in this painting, presenting the flying objects in cheerful hues while the overall image is pervaded by a monochromatic gray. Not only does that color have a negative connotation, it is also the color of airplanes and other machines of war. Much of the scene is suffused by a soft haze, which may have been meant to be radioactive dust, for it appears in some of his other antiatomic images. Evergood was in Santa Fe when an atomic bomb was tested and recorded how he was sickened physically and mentally by these preparations for human destruction (Kendall F. Taylor, Philip Evergood and the Humanist Tradition, Ph.D. diss., Syracuse University, 1979, p. 106). The title Everybody Wants to Live is a plea for the future of mankind, but even this plea has its ironic twist. Evergood may have originally entitled the painting less positively, for nobody wants to die was written on the back of the canvas and then covered over with white paint.', ''),

According to the inscription on the back of the canvas, the large fruit was grown by Charles Nova in Los Angeles in 1864, but efforts to document a farmer with that name as then residing in Los Angeles have proved futile.  The enormous weight of the pear--four pounds--must have caused quite a stir. California was perceived as a garden paradise, and the pearâ€™s size demonstrated the richness of the land. In the late 1870s, when the railroad linking the East and Southern California was completed, railroad companies issued posters extolling the fecundity of the land; one lithograph, depicting an array of fruit, referred to California as the cornucopia of the world.', ''),

These still-life paintings became Breckenridgeâ€™s primary means of experiment. He wrote that still life was the purest art of painting for it has no story to tell, other than that of line, form and color (Valley House Gallery, unpublished book, p. 64 [Archiv. Am. Art microfilm roll 2410, fr. 266]). The Altar Cloth is typical of such experiments and is also characteristic of Breckenridgeâ€™s bolder style. Like many early American modernists, he was most influenced by Paul CÃ©zanne (1839-1906) and Henri Matisse (1869-1954). He considered CÃ©zanne to be the greatest artist of modern times, and the slightly tilted tabletop here recalls CÃ©zanneâ€™s still lifes. The painting is indebted to Matisseâ€™s paintings of his fauve period for its brilliant color. Breckenridge did not hesitate to employ richly saturated hues of rose, emerald green, lavender, and ultramarine, even utilizing equally expressive colors in the shadows. The tall white vase in the center is framed by a green jar on the right and a white bowl and bright green cloth on the left. In typical postimpressionist fashion, Breckenridge placed the complementary color of the rose drape next to the green objects. Breckenridge often borrowed from Matisse the device of placing a painting or patterned hanging, here an altar cloth, behind the objects on the table to compromise the illusion of space by emphasizing surface pattern. During the 1910s Breckenridge often worked closely with Arthur B. Carles (1880-1952), and the two even used the same objects in their still-life compositions. Both artists shared pictorial concerns and a debt to the fauve palette of Matisse. When The Altar Cloth is compared with Carlesâ€™s still-life paintings of this period an essential difference arises: no matter how bold Breckenridge is with his palette, he remains more conservative than Carles in his treatment of form. In The Altar Cloth Breckenridge did not completely relinquish traditional modeling and shading, while in his paintings Carles boldly flattened and simplified his objects. Breckenridgeâ€™s modernism at this stage of his development was allied to his use of nonreferential, expressionist color. Indeed, years later Carles acknowledged Breckenridge as the one who taught him about color resonance. It was the color of GEORGE INNESS that first attracted Breckenridge to painting in the 1880s, and color was always to dominate in his more avant-garde works. The museumâ€™s painting was frequently exhibited before William Preston Harrison saw it in Chicago and acquired it in 1923. While Harrison knew that artists with an impressionist slant, such as FREDERICK CARL FRIESEKE, disliked Breckenridgeâ€™s modernism, Harrison believed that Breckenridge was a fine painter with a style all his own.', ''),

He practiced this approach all his life and taught it to his pupils. Before undertaking his paintings of the boxers and other athletes that he painted at the end of the 1890s, Eakins spent hours watching the men, studying their movements in light of his knowledge of anatomy. He posed two wrestlers in the Quaker City Athletic Club and in his studio, where in May 1899 several photographs were taken. The man on top is Joseph McCann, a wrestler and champion boxer. He is posed holding his opponent in a half nelson and crotch hold, potentially close to winning. Eakins copied the photograph of this pose almost directly onto a canvas, 1899 (Philadelphia Museum of Art), the purpose of which would have been to clarify the details of musculature that were unclear in the photograph. The next step in the preparatory process was the museum''''s small oil painting, which served as a compositional sketch. In it the artist worked out the placement of the figures in the composition of the finished canvas Wrestlers, 1899, also owned by the LACMA. Eakins made some slight changes in the positions of the wrestlers, especially in the right leg of the lower man and in the head and shoulders of the upper man. Eakins''''s main interest was in placing them in relation to the figures he was now introducing, the lower body of an observer or referee on the right and a man at a rowing machine in the upper left. The short white line at the referee''''s foot represents the rope that marked off the boundaries of the wrestling arena. The men were nude in the photograph and initial figure study but wear trunks in the large finished version. The black area in the museum''''s sketch that looks as though it might represent trunks probably is only an indication of an area of shadow. Athletes in the period wore light-colored trunks that were cut very high over the hips as seen in the finished painting.  Achieving the proper balance within the composition was especially important to Eakins at this point in his career, because of his increased awareness of surface design and internal structure. Like most artists at the turn of the century Eakins introduced into his paintings devices that had the effect of compromising the illusion of depth while creating a more even, overall, decorative pattern; in this example he did so by the placement of the rower in the extreme upper left corner and by cropping the standing man with the top edge of the painting, which pulls what is normally the part farthest away into the same plane as that of the foreground figures of the wrestlers.

Well traveled and erudite, Wheelwright turned to painting, first studying art around 1850 in the Parisian atelier of EugÃ¨ne CicÃ©ri (1813-1890), a landscape painter. Five years later, inspired by Hunt, he returned to France and persuaded Millet to become his teacher. Their student-teacher association was quite formal, the only one of its kind to be made by an American with Millet. However, Wheelwright never seriously pursued the career of an artist. After his return to the United States, he turned his attention to other aspects of art, becoming a critic for the Atlantic Monthly in the late 1870s. He actively promoted the reputation of Millet in this country, through his article Personal Recollections of Jean-Franqois Millee, of 1876 in the Atlantic Monthly and through his assisting the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in raising funds for the purchase of paintings by Millet.  In June 1856 Wheelwright returned home after spending nine months in Barbizon. He joined Hunt at Newport, becoming part of the intimate circle of artists and writers around Hunt and his family. It was at this time that Hunt painted his portrait. With his return to the United States, Hunt entered the field of portraiture, and Wheelwrightâ€™s bust is an early example of Huntâ€™s extensive work in that genre. Some of his best portraits were created during his Newport years. Although he received numerous commissions, he often painted his friends.  Huntâ€™s handling of the portrait reveals his French training, in particular the influence of Thomas Couture and Millet. The overall effect is one of softness, in contrast to the harsh clarity typical of mid-nineteenth-century American portraits. Hunt built up Wheelwrightâ€™s face with light and dark passages of color, including different shades of pinks, roses, and oranges, vigorously applied in small strokes over a warm underdrawing. The head is quite plastic, but its contour is blurred. The warm tonal palette of browns is carried through into the background, although less densely.', ''),

The activity is always sweet and innocent. Here two lovely young maidens collect flowers as the third figure, in the back, plays her guitar and serenades them. Following the example of Adolphe Monticelli (1824-1886) and his highly impastoed surfaces, Williams applied his paint thickly, layering the glazes with scumbling so that the surface appears to be encrusted. He restricted the palette to the deep, sumptuous hues of the forest: oranges, ochers, greens, and browns. The entire painting has an effervescence as light flickers over the jewellike surface.

Its incomplete state gave BouchÃ© the opportunity to paint the landscape background of the easel painting in broad, full strokes.

The transformation was apparent in the paintings he made for the Saturday Evening Post covers beginning around the mid-1940s. The change was encouraged by a new layout of the cover that separated the title from the illustration and the appointment of Ken Stuart as art editor in 1944. Stuart wanted the covers to be portraits of a nation in change. The subject of this painting could not have been more topical, since the general public only started purchasing televisions during the late 1940s. During the decade Rockwell increasingly used photographs in his preparatory work so that he could pay more attention to the setting, rather than the figures, as he had earlier. Consequently a new concern for architectural subjects, seen most often in detailed interiors, appeared in his art. He depicted architectural exteriors less frequently. By setting The New Television Set on the roof of a house, Rockwell used architecture not only to structure the composition but also to convey the contrast of the old, the house, with the new, the television. The scene epitomizes the rapid modernization of America, for the house was one of many large Victorian structures characteristic of the district around Adams Street in Los Angeles, where it was painted. Rockwellâ€™s association with Los Angeles was long and close, beginning in 1930, when he met his wife, Mary Barstow, on his first trip to the city. During the 1940s he wintered here and was artist-in-residence at Otis Art Institute (Los Angeles County Art Institute). He became friendly with his students and asked some of them to serve as his models. For The New Television Set Robert H. Horton, at the time an architecture student, posed as the television serviceman, and Jack Farman, another student, served as the model for the elderly customer. The painting was reproduced on the cover of the November 5, 1949, issue of the Saturday Evening Post. Rockwell presented the painting to Ned Crowell, a close friend who was West Coast district manager for the Curtis Publishing Company, among whose many publications was the Saturday Evening Post.', ''),

Russell was preoccupied with the heroic form of the human figure from his earliest days as an artist, when, inspired by Michelangelo, he sculpted a nude male; even the synchromies were based on the movement of the human form. In his late paintings Russell stressed the solidity of the nudeâ€™s body as would a sculptor. Piscine reveals the artistâ€™s fascination with the human physique. The lack of interaction between the figures would suggest that Russell explored different aspects of the body by painting one model in four different poses and from four different angles. Russell knew that a rich palette would distract from the figures, which he intended to be the primary expressive element, and consequently Piscine is limited to dull tones of gold and bluish purples. Color was always important to Russell, however, and in his late figure painting he based his palette on what he considered to be classic colors. As do the figures in his late religious paintings, the nudes in Piscine seem to float rather than to stand solidly at the edge of the pool. Piscine was one of several paintings that the artist asked Frank L. Stevens to store for him. Unknown to Russell, Stevens buried the paintings. After Stevensâ€™s death the paintings were disinterred, and Macdonald-Wright obtained some of them, including Piscine.', ''),

Hord carved Young Maize, 1931 (San Diego Museum of Art), as a powerful young man symbolizing the sturdy stalk of a new plant. In The Corn Goddess Hord presents a strong, voluptuous figure to suggest the fecundity of the earth. The waves of her elaborate hair arrangement form a soft bed from which two ears of corn emerge, and two small figures representing sprouting corn grow upwards on stalks from her back. This swirling arrangement of hair, an essential, symbolic element, is present in many of Hordâ€™s carvings of the early 1940s, as are figures depicted with the broad, fiat facial features of the Native American. Hord preferred the harder types of stone and wood for his sculpture. During World War II he could not obtain rosewood, so he used lignum vitae, which takes a beautiful polish, and he used it for Corn Goddess. Hord worked on his wood objects himself, without the aid of his assistant, Homer Dana, and this piece required three months to complete. Although he had been taught to leave the chisel marks showing, in the early 1930s Hord began the practice for which he became famous: polishing a piece to a high gloss to expose the woodâ€™s grain.', '');

Paanakker (59.72)', 'Coney Island was the first painting Cadmus made after he ceased working for the federally sponsored Public Works of Art Project. It is typical of his paintings of the period in both theme and form. Cadmus viewed the prosaic activity of bathing on a beach in devastatingly satirical terms. Poking fun at the bathersâ€™ carefree pleasures, Cadmus accumulated an odd assortment of bulging, burnt bodies. The bathers are oblivious to their ridiculous appearance and uncouth behavior. Swarming the beach, their bodies are strangely intertwined, their faces smiling inanely. Everything is exaggerated, the color verging on the garish to intensify their grossness. In the 1930s Cadmus used oil paint almost as if it were a graphic medium, consequently Coney Island looks more like a tinted drawing than a painting. His small, exacting brushstrokes impart a flickering quality to the surface, which intensifies the impression that the figures are in constant motion. Cadmus actually began to sketch the scene on Marthaâ€™s Vineyard, before he visited Coney Island. He was attracted to the Brooklyn beach because it offered him the opportunity to delineate the human figure with as little clothing as possible. Moreover, he considered the beach scene to be a classical subject. His treatment, however, is rather baroque. As was his friend REGINALD MARSH, Cadmus was attracted to the elaborate compositions of old master paintings. Coney Island, with its seminude figures arranged in complex groupings, their bodies twisted and in constant motion, was for Cadmus the twentieth-century version of a baroque allegorical composition. Cadmus claimed that his intent was not to be sensational, but when the painting was exhibited in the Whitney Museum of American Artâ€™s second biennial, it suffered the same hostile reception as did his earlier The Fleetâ€™s In!. The Coney Island Showmenâ€™s League, a local trade group, denounced the painting as offensive and inaccurate and threatened a libel suit if the painting was not removed from the exhibition. According to the artistâ€™s incomplete records, it seems that the painting was rejected from several annual exhibitions to which it was submitted soon after it was shown at the Whitney biennial, probably because of the controversy it stirred. In 1935 Cadmus produced an etching from a photograph of the painting in the hope that it would reach a larger public. In the etching the image is reversed but otherwise differs only in a few minor details (see Related Works).', ''),

In the 1920s Stettheimer became fascinated with the design theories of Adolfo Best-Maugard (1891-1964), whose principles of composition were based on simplicity and conventionalized, childlike images. Stettheimerâ€™s repeated use of a frontal view of a vase of flowers and drapery swag may have been related to Best-Maugardâ€™s emphasis on such motifs. Stettheimer painted the vase, background, and festoon in white with tints of pink and gray underpaint. White was her color, for she not only used it extensively in her painting as a color and to key up her palette, she also surrounded herself with white, often wearing a fringed white dress and decorating her studio in white lace and fringed drapery. The garland draped above the vase in the museumâ€™s painting alludes to her canopied bed. The vase of flowers appears to exist in a sheltered, private niche, safe from the outside world, just as Stettheimer lived in an exclusive, refined world that she created. Even the thickly impastoed surface, characteristic of Stettheimerâ€™s mature art, suggests the pure sensuosity of her maidenly, but artistically rich, life.', ''),

Although Berlin probably never visited France, by the 1920s cubism was well known in Los Angeles and he would have been aware of it. In this painting the figures are fused with the surrounding environment in a configuration of overlapping and intersecting faceted planes and ray lines, standard cubist devices. During the 1920s, when this canvas may have been painted, STANTON MACDONALDWRIGHT was the dominant force in Los Angelesâ€™s modernist circles. His art, although exhibiting more arabesque lines, may have influenced Berlinâ€™s treatment of the figure, especially in his use of delicate, translucent planes. The cubist art of Lorser Feitelson, who became a major progressive force in Los Angeles after his move to the West Coast in 1927, also may have served as a model for Berlin. A painting that may have directly inspired Figures is Nude Descending a Staircase (No. 2), 1912 (Philadelphia Museum of Art), by Marcel Duchamp (1887-1968). Duchampâ€™s often reproduced painting was a notorious modernist work, and it is likely that Berlin became acquainted with it through the collector Walter Arensberg, who had settled in Hollywood in the 1920s and always opened his home to artists. Arensberg did not acquire the painting until 1930, but before that time he proudly displayed a color reproduction of it. As in Duchampâ€™s painting, Berlinâ€™s cubist analysis of movement results in an allover composition of intersecting planes and diagonal lines colored in a somber dominant hue. The dark lines are in blue with brighter, warm colors brushed in to create a translucent effect. Figures may have been one of the paintings, as was Rhythmic Forms (unlocated), in Berlinâ€™s 1924 exhibition at the Potboiler, for in an article commenting on the show, Berlin was praised for being one of the first to attempt the depiction of the fourth dimension.', ''),

According to Achille Segard, the painting was exhibited during April 1880 in the Fifth Impressionist Exhibition. Although none of Cassattâ€™s contributions is enumerated in the catalogue, she is known to have shown eight paintings. If Mother about to Wash Her Sleepy Child was included, then the customary explanation of Cassattâ€™s use of this theme, i.e., that she began painting the subject after spending much time with her nieces and nephews during her brother Alexanderâ€™s visit to France in the summer of 1880, is incorrect. Whatever her initial motivation, Cassatt would devote nearly one third of her artistic production to such themes, as did many artists of the period.  Mother about to Wash Her Sleepy Child is an example of Cassattâ€™s work as an impressionist, shortly before her mature, more solid style began to emerge. In the 1870s, no doubt inspired by Degas and other French impressionists, Cassatt began depicting intimate domestic scenes, often of figures in interiors. In this painting a woman tenderly washes her child. The image is cropped on both sides --a favorite device of Degas, who borrowed it from contemporary photographs and Japanese prints -- and the entire scene is slightly tilted up and compressed into the narrow foreground. The stripes of the chairâ€™s upholstery and the wallpaper intensify this verticality. While the Japanese qualities of Cassattâ€™s art are usually considered in terms of her later paintings and prints, she actually assimilated the oriental aesthetic quite early. Already apparent in Mother about to Wash Her Sleepy Child are the use of an intimate subject and a skillfully balanced surface design incorporating areas of patterning, both encouraged by the example of Japanese prints.  Historians have often commented on the pose of the child, especially the position of his legs, finding sources in Madonna and Child images by Parmigianino (1503-1540) and Antonio Correggio (1494-1534). Although Cassatt knew of Italian religious painting and late nineteenth-century artists tended to dress biblical persons in contemporary attire, such historical sources are not necessary to explain the pose. Such awkward naturalism is quite typical of works by her mentor, Degas, and demonstrates how Cassatt utilized every aspect of the scene to convey the modernity, the untraditional representation, of the image. The overall surface is quite sketchy, as Cassatt vigorously brushed out contour lines with thick pigment to convey a sense of the momentary. Nevertheless, the form is not lost, as demonstrated by the motherâ€™s superbly delineated right hand.  In the 1870s, influenced by the impressionists, Cassatt began to lighten and brighten her palette. In her work she reflects the impressionist fascination with the color white. Although the palette used here is lighter than that of her previous paintings, it still exhibits an intense hue, as Cassatt explored the reflection of the blue and green of the setting and the flesh tones on the white attire of the figures and the interaction of all the colors. The delicate tints and brushwork are combined to create a shimmering surface.  The painting was bought by Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Atmore Pope, Americans whom Cassatt met in Naugatuck, Connecticut, in 1898-99 during her first trip home since the Franco-Prussian War. Pope had amassed a fortune in the steel industry, and by the time of his introduction to Cassatt had already begun to collect impressionist paintings, which now constitute the collection of the Hill-Stead Museum, Farmington, Connecticut. The Popesâ€™ daughter, Theodate, became Cassattâ€™s most intimate young friend.', ''),

Stuempfigâ€™s themes and many of his formal devices are derived from surrealism and particularly from the variation of that movement most widely joined in the United Sates, magic realism. Like the work of this period by ANDREW WYETH, an artist living nearby in the Philadelphia area, Stuempfigâ€™s paintings appear to be realistic but depict the world of dreams and fantasy. The objective of both painters was to evoke in the viewer a certain mood from that realm. Stuempfig freely manipulated formal devices to undercut the seeming realism of his paintings, subtly suggesting a haunting strangeness. Strong frameworks of verticals and horizontals make the space in his paintings seem clear and organized, but large, central, empty spaces and conspicuously large separations between presumably related elements give the space a dreamlike quality. Strong effects of light and shadow, often from a raking light, enhance the impression of realism by bringing out the texture of surfaces, but the overly strong contrast of light and shadow in the modeling of the figures, recalling the early baroque period, injects a note of drama and menace. In this painting the extreme contrast in the modeling of the figure is particularly puzzling because the direct light from the window is shown to be striking the wall. A further quality of disquietude and unreality comes from the difficulty the viewer experiences in seeking to identify the subject of Stuempfigâ€™s paintings. Almost always there are figures, typically tough, adolescent males, who stand about idly, lost in their own troubling thoughts, without a relationship of position or action to any other figure or object in the painting. In the museumâ€™s painting this sense of thematic ambiguity is heightened by the familiar surrealist device of the juxtaposition of two conceivably related objects. The viewer must wonder about the relationship between the youth and the empty birdcage resting on an upturned music stand in this painting just as one wonders about the relationship between the similarly posed young man and the isolated houses in Stuempfigâ€™s painting, Two Houses, c. 1940s (Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.). The stiles of the antique chair, behind which the boy stands, establish a visual metaphor for the bars of the birdcage, perhaps hinting at the youthâ€™s spiritual captivity. The settings of most of Stuempfigâ€™s paintings are entirely imaginary or greatly transformed, but the titles of a certain number of them acknowledge that he has painted his studio, as he may have done in the present case. The same chair and a similarly spare interior are seen in his painting Solitary Figure, 1948 (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco). The same model may be portrayed in Stuempfigâ€™s painting Portrait of Charles, 1949 (art market, 1974).', ''),

His interest in religious and allegorical painting had been kindled by the Raphaelesque Italian and German ideal subjects he had seen in Rome on his first trip to Europe in 1839. By the 1860s his models were the Venetian artists of the High Renaissance, especially Titian (c. 1488-1576), whose example can be seen in the costumes and figure types depicted in Philosophy and Christian Art. The model or the type of the old man also appears in Huntingtonâ€™s Sowing the Word, 1868 (New-York Historical Society). The influence of the Venetian school can also be seen in the rounder forms and richer palette of his paintings of this period. Even the halflength format seems to echo Venetian examples. The model for the painting to which the young lady gestures, however, appears to be The Adoration of the Shepherds, 1650, by JosÃ© Ribera (1588-1652) in the Louvre, Paris. The painting is conceived as a conversation between embodiments of opposing, but equally worthy points of view. The wisdom of the aged scholar, reading a book by lamplight, is contrasted with the intuitive perceptions of the young woman who examines a work of art by the daylight signified by the window. Huntington has cast in terms of ideal figures one of the pressing problems of his own times, when scientific findings seemed to challenge the truth and wisdom of religion conveyed by artistic and other nonscientific forms of perception.', ''),

In the middle ground, at the extreme right, just below the hill with the white farmhouse flows the Unadilla River. A pencil drawing dated 1873 locates the exact spot Cropsey chose to delineate. In fact, the painting deviates little from the preparatory drawing and consequently takes on the character of a topographical record. It was just such numerous details presented on a large scale that critics such as Henry James found fault with when the painting was exhibited at the annual exhibition of the National Academy of Design in 1875. During the eleven years following his return from England in 1863, Cropsey added to his growing reputation with a number of largescale, panoramic landscapes of northeastern American scenery. In Sidney Plains, as in the earlier Valley of Wyoming, 1865 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), he attempted to epitomize the settling of the wilderness. Cropsey depicted manâ€™s encroaching on the wild landscape as he fenced in orchards and grazing fields for cows and sheep. Such expansion was then seen as progress and was associated with the advancement of modern technology, here indicated by the presence of telegraph poles and a distant train. The completion of the Erie Railroad line to Binghamton through the Alleghenies in 1848 had made the area more accessible to New York City. Cropseyâ€™s landscape represents a nostalgic image of the settling of the American frontier. The railroad was crucial to the settlement of the American wilderness and in this painting may have had more than iconographic significance. Cropsey may have painted Sidney Plains for the railroad magnate John Taylor Johnston. There is conflicting information concerning the name of the original owner: when the landscape was exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1875, the owner was listed as John H. Johnston, and literature thereafter referred to the owner as John N. Johnston or John J. Johnston. John T. Johnston was a collector of American painting and the first president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. If he were the owner, Sidney Plains was not sold in 1876 when business circumstances forced him to sell much of his collection. John T. Johnston may have kept the painting or given it to his son, John Herbert Johnston, owner of the Tenth Street Studio Building, where many New York artists rented studios. Although John Taylor Johnston did not own the Erie Railroad pictured in Cropseyâ€™s landscape, his Lehigh and Susquehanna line provided one of the links from the seaboard to the inland.  Sidney Plains is painted in Cropseyâ€™s characteristic autumnal palette, which, according to the color notes written on the preparatory drawing, he found in nature. The sun breaking through the moist haze has the appearance of shafts of light. Although they can be explained as a natural phenomenon, these pearly hued rays imply a divine blessing on the land and its settlement.', ''),

In August 1879 Sargent spent six enjoyable weeks at Ronjoux, the Buloz summer home in Savoy, in southeastern France. Before leaving, he painted a portrait of his hostess, Mme Buloz, as a gift for her. Mme Buloz (nÃ©e Christine Blaze de Bury) later professed to her sister that she did not care for the portrait, I do not find it flattering enough; it is as I will look in ten years time if God allows me to live that long!  Despite Mme Bulozâ€™s objections, the portrait Sargent created clearly demonstrates his ability to capture a sitterâ€™s character. He presented Mme Buloz, an elderly woman, in a direct, frontal pose. As she quietly looks out at the viewer, her forthright but gentle gaze suggests a perceptive personality. Sargentâ€™s brushwork is spontaneous; with a deft hand and few strokes he sensitively modeled her expressive face. In such portrait sketches Sargent often conveyed greater vitality and freshness than in his more finished, commissioned works. Although Mme Buloz wears black and emerges from a shadowy interior, the portrait is rich, demonstrating that at this early stage Sargent was already a master of the restricted palette that his teacher had extolled.', ''),

It portrays a commanding view of Cathedral Rocks, which are in the valley along a bend in the Merced River. Nothing obstructs the panoramic view. A bit of the river bank is included as a repoussoir to lead the viewer into the scene. The towering trees are arranged on the sides to permit an open vista of the cliffs. The addition of the riders, while suggesting a narrative, was also essential to the composition. Even the pile of dead tree trunks in the center of the painting was arranged so that the large logs would link the two sides of the painting.  Keith created many such epic paintings during the period between his two European trips, and many of these were criticized as too artificial. Although the general appearance of this version might give the impression of a standard picturesque composition, Keith avoided the tight, linear painting style associated with the DÃ¼sseldorf school. He also escaped the pervasive grays of such German landscapes by infusing the background of Yosemite Valley with an array of soft, opalescent hues.', ''),

Although not a history painting, it demonstrates his total mastery of the technique that would make those paintings so successful. Produced while Neal worked in Pilotyâ€™s atelier, After the Hunt exemplifies the style of romantic realism practiced and taught by his professor. During the late 1860s Piloty had transformed the teaching of the Munich academy by introducing an emphasis on skillful painting technique. Although based on the work of the old masters, the style he taught was capable of impressive realism of lighting and textures. It also reflected painstaking research of authentic settings, costumes, and accessories. After the Hunt, with its baroque lighting, dramatic contrasts, and rich, warm tonality, strikes the note of romanticism central to the style. The aristocratic hunter and the servant girl dressed in period costume, nominally the subject of the painting, are secondary to the foreground still-life arrangement, in which Nealâ€™s virtuosity has persuasively reproduced a wide range of textures. Still-life compositions are rare in the Munich tradition in contrast to that of Vienna, where this type--the corner of a room with a table piled with bric-a-brac -- was known. Two other Americans, WILLIAM M. CHASE and Theodore Wores (18601939), also included background figures in the most important still life they produced during their student years in Munich.

Economic growth, spurred by new technologies such as the railroad and telegraph, assisted the early stages of empire building. As a comfortable and expanding middle class began to demonstrate its wealth and power, a fervent nationalist spirit was celebrated in the writings of Walt Whitman and Herman Melville. Artists such as Emanuel Leutze produced history paintings re-creating the glorious past of the relatively new country. Such idealizations ignored the mounting political and social differences that threatened to split the country apart. The Civil War slowed development, affecting every fiber of society, but surprisingly was not the theme of many paintings. The warâ€™s devastation did not destroy the American belief in progress, and there was an undercurrent of excitement due to economic expansion and increased settlement of the West. <BR>During the postwar period Americans also began enthusiastically turning their attention abroad. They flocked to Europe to visit London, Paris, Rome, Florence, and Berlin, the major cities on the Grand Tour.

No doubt because of his affiliation with the Woodstock colony, most are of sites in upstate New York. Landscape was painted at Rondout Basin, near Kingston, New York, a small town along the Hudson River north of New York City. This painting probably dates from the 1920s, perhaps the later part of the decade, as indicated by the similarity of its brushwork to that in dated landscapes from that period or later. A dating to the 1920s would coincide with the period when George Bellows, a close friend of Speicherâ€™s, was working at Woodstock, which also may explain the vigor of the brushwork. The warehouse and ramshackle buildings are presented as simplified geometric forms built up with short, heavy, staccato brushstrokes of opaque paint. While the overall palette is somber to convey the drabness of the townâ€™s riverfront, it is enlivened with passages of warm rose and orange hues.

With her hands tightly folded, she turns toward the right where a small glass of violets, symbols of death, rests on a bare wood table. In this vividly realist work Page displays a thorough knowledge of the human figure, based no doubt on his academic training.

Lancaster and Harold Hecht, producers of the motion picture, admired Bentonâ€™s art, and it was upon their initiative that Benton received the commission. Except for its showing at the movieâ€™s premiere in Washington, D.C., the canvas was never exhibited until its donation to the museum. It was, however, reproduced on labels for bottles of Beamâ€™s Choice whiskey. As early as the 1910s Benton had painted portraits and historical pieces for the budding motion-picture industry, which was then based in Fort Lee, New Jersey. In 1937 Benton was sent by Life magazine to paint Hollywood, 1937 (Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, Mo.), perhaps his best-known work related to the industry. He visited the movie capital many times over the next decades and was often commissioned by the studios to create works used as advertisements, such as lithographs for The Grapes of Wrath and a painting for The Long Voyage Home. In 1946 he came to Hollywood to work with Walt Disney. To capture the essence of The Kentuckian, Benton read the script and in the autumn of 1953 spent several days on location in Rockport, Indiana, watching the filming. The movie features a backwoodsman and his son who confront civilization in the form of a frontier village. Benton chose to epitomize the movieâ€™s theme with the image of the backwoodsman, Big Eli Wakesfield, played by Burt Lancaster, and his son Little Eli, played by Donald MacDonald, just before they see the town for the first time. The American West and the progress of civilization were of special interest to Benton, who had portrayed these themes in his early murals. In this painting the Kentuckian becomes the archetypal frontiersman leading his family to the golden land in the West. The Kentuckian heads toward the unseen village, located somewhere ahead in a sunny valley. He strides forward, high on a hill against a cloudfilled sky. This baroque compositional device, echoed by the diagonal positions of the boy and the dog, emphasizes the Kentuckianâ€™s dynamic vitality. Although the paintingâ€™s large size may have been determined by the commission, the heroic presentation was surely Bentonâ€™s idea, for many of his late easel paintings are more tightly focused around a single large figure than were his early mural scenes. Also typical of Bentonâ€™s later paintings is his portrayal of the forms in strong colors with crisp outlines and an undulating plasticity. Bentonâ€™s methodical working procedure was always laborious, and for The Kentuckian he created numerous drawings, including a cubist, diagrammatic study; preparatory oils; and a clay model of the boyâ€™s figure.

Fruit Still Life in a Landscape was commissioned by Mrs. Alma White of Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Its provenance and similarity to the large painting of fruit, n.d., in the collection of the Lycoming Hotel, Williamsport, firmly date the museumâ€™s painting to the period the artist lived in Williamsport. Few of his fruit pieces from the 1860s are dated, and his mature style, once established, did not change much in his fruit still-life compositions until very late. The presence of a landscape background in the Fruit Still Life with Wine Glass and Coins in a Landscape, dated 1861 (private collection), suggests a date in the early 1860s for the museumâ€™s painting, but a painting with a more similar landscape background bears the date of 1867 (Amon Carter Museum, Fort Worth, Texas). A still life of flowers with a landscape background (private collection) bears the date of 1850, but it appears that Roesen used such backgrounds more often during the 1860s.  The landscape in the museumâ€™s painting is an unusual feature that adds a dramatic note. Roesenâ€™s adoption of landscape backgrounds is thought to reflect the taste, inspired by the English Pre-Raphaelites, for still-life compositions in a natural setting. Roesenâ€™s response is a somewhat artificial compromise, in which he set his conventional tabletop still life in front of a landscape, with little connection between the two. His landscape compositions almost always conform to the formula of trees and road on the left, clouded sky and distant hills on the right. Numerous other aspects of the museumâ€™s painting also employ formulas familiar in Roesenâ€™s work, for instance, the corner of a gold-fringed pillow emerging from a fold in a large cloth.  Roesenâ€™s central theme is that of abundant fruitfulness. The composition is so crowded that it appears as though a great cornucopia is spilling fruit from one tier to the other and out into the viewerâ€™s space. Roesen uses the trompe lâ€™oeil device of having fruits and leaves overhang the edges of the table, but this confuses the sense of space within the painting; the predominant appearance is that of a single wall of fruit, which enhances the paintingâ€™s decorative character. The color in the museumâ€™s painting is exceptionally strong for the artist. The primary colors are announced in the group of lemon peel, cherries, and blue plum on the lower shelf.

Shoemaker (M.77.141)', 'In his address given at the memorial for Sanford Gifford, WORTHINGTON WHITTREDGE said that no autumn came that Gifford did not visit his mother in the town of Hudson and the nearby Catskills. He loved the mountains and painted them more than any other subject. The motif of this painting is the Kaaterskill, or Kauterskill, Clove, a scenic gorge of the small Kaaterskill Creek that extends about five miles between Haines Falls village and Palenville. It was a theme for numerous Hudson River school artists, and Gifford sketched there as early as 1845 and exhibited a painting of the clove. From this direct study, possibly together with others, he completed both the wellknown Kauterskill Clove, 1862 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), and the museumâ€™s painting October in the Catskills, eighteen years later. The artist was known for repeating favorite subjects with slight refinements. The true subject of the painting is the lighted atmosphere that fills a great natural bowl, as in some of his other paintings. With Mr. Gifford, landscape, painting is air-painting, wrote George Sheldon in 1879 (American Painters [New York: D. Appleton], p. 17). By sacrificing distant detail to the palpable, shimmering atmosphere, as in the museumâ€™s painting, Gifford achieved a poetic interpretation of impressions that the motif and nature in general had made on him. In this spirit he freely arranged and modified elements in his finished paintings, which were studio creations.  A comparison with the Metropolitan Museumâ€™s Kauterskill Clove shows how Gifford marshaled his materials in October in the Catskills for an entirely different effect and feeling. The vantage point is higher, eliminating the view of the lake but increasing awareness of the plain and mountains stretching into the distance. The artist has also moved the trees and rocks on the left from the near foreground to the immediate foreground. The combined effect of these changes is to substitute, for the gentle progression into the distance in the Metropolitan Museumâ€™s painting, a dramatic leap from a bulky, immediate foreground almost directly into the uninhabited far distance. This was a device often used by ALBERT BIERSTADT to enhance an impression of overwhelming distance. Also different is the quality of light in the two paintings. Kauterskill Clove is bathed in a delicate combination of yellows and blues, whereas the light in October in the Catskills is described by much hotter yellows and reds, emanating from a visible sun that seems to ignite the foreground foliage. Gifford has rearranged the ridges of the clove in a more regular arrangement that seems to center upon the sun. The sun is a potent force in the painting, appearing to dissolve the distant mountains into something like the vortices that swirl within the landscapes of J. M. W. Turner (1775-1851). The distance is defined entirely in terms of the action of the sun, reflecting in the waterfall and tiny distant houses. The overall impression is that of a powerful force in a vast primeval wilderness.  A very similar painting of the same subject, dimensions, and date, but with the foreground rocks and trees reversed on the right side of the canvas, appeared on the art market in New York (see Related Works). It cannot be determined whether the provenance and early citations in the 1881 Memorial Catalogue refer to the museumâ€™s painting or this other one.', '');

He painted two almost identical versions, both dated 1923. He exhibited these canvases simultaneously throughout the country at annual art exhibitions from 1923 to 1925. The other version (Mattatuck Museum, Waterbury, Connecticut) was awarded prizes when it was exhibited at the National Academy of Design in New York and the Art Institute of Chicago, while the museumâ€™s painting was awarded the John Schaffer Prize at the First Pan-American Exhibition of Oil Paintings at the museum in 1925-26. Although the smaller of the two, the museumâ€™s painting is probably not a study in view of its large scale and complete finish. It may have been the first version, since in it basic changes to the composition are discernible: areas of a more opaque overpainting cover alterations, most notably a change in direction of the scales. The Italianate architectural frame is original and typical of Savageâ€™s presentation of his early easel paintings as early Renaissance altarpieces. The frame and painting technique reflect Savageâ€™s attempt to echo the early Renaissance masters he had studied in Italy. Desiring his painting to appear as an old master fresco, Savage prepared the canvas surface with a thick layer of gesso, roughened the overall surface, and then sculpted many of the details before beginning to paint. The oil paint was applied in thin, transparent layers, which were wiped and set with a fixative, further creating the illusion of a frescoed surface. Although the size and format suggest that Savage intended the painting to resemble an altarpiece, the subject is a modern allegory inspired by World War I. The artist employed the religious imagery of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as the central motif to symbolize the warâ€™s destruction. A bulletin that was issued at the time the Los Angeles Art Association purchased the painting provides a detailed analysis of the imagery: the Four Horsemen trampling the world into ruins signify not only the tragedy of war in general but the recurring cycle of war, conquest, plague, and death. The older figure of the crowned archer is Greed, who releases his shaft of envy and hate toward the far horizon, while War, bearing a sword, is joined by Pestilence with his scales and Death with his scythe. A wounded man in uniform lies dying in the foreground. Remnants of the civilization that was destroyed by the war are scattered throughout. The large rose window of a cathedral forms a center backdrop and refers to the church, the support of humanity through the ages. For Savage the church imagery refers to the literary source of the paintingâ€™s theme and title: Rudyard Kiplingâ€™s famous poem Recessional (1897). Kipling believed that throughout the course of history God alone was immutable. On the left, sheltered by a stone arch, an idealized female nude symbolizing Bereavement and Truth holds an infant who symbolizes the hope of Regeneration. At her feet are scattered a number of books, the largest of which is a Bible open to the Beatitudes. The two versions of Recessional differ only in minor details: in the museumâ€™s version the infant has hair falling over her left eye (perhaps symbolically obstructing her view of the future), fewer books are piled up in the lower left, and the stonework of the wall in the background is different. The painting was acquired through public subscription; over two hundred subscribers, including socially prominent figures and artists organizations, contributed through the Los Angles Art Association. Among them were the critic Arthur Millier and painters Carl Oscar Borg, Paul Sample, and HANSON PUTHUFF. Such diverse support reveals both Savageâ€™s stature during the thirties and the continued appetite for war memorials following the first World War.', ''),

The decorations Duncanson created from 1848 to 1850 for Belmont, the home of his patron Nicholas Longworth (now the Taft Museum, Cincinnati), may have stimulated his interest in such subject matter. Although painted in a different, more rococo style, the decorative panels included two overdoor designs of fruit and flowers in vases. Longworth was not only a lawyer and a major patron of the arts but one of the finest horticulturists in America. He played a major role in the commercialization of grapes and cultivation of strawberries. However, in none of Duncansonâ€™s located still, lifes did the artist focus on grapes. Rather, in the fashion of most still-life specialists, he included a variety of food: apples, grapes, oranges, raisins, nuts, pineapples, and honeycombs. The last two items were considered exotic and often were included in Victorian still lifes; in the South the pineapple was a symbol of hospitality.  Still Life is a transitional piece, exhibiting characteristics typical of both early- and midnineteenth-century American still-life paintings, due in part to the date of the painting and to the fact that it was painted in a frontier environment, which slightly lagged behind the East in artistic developments. In the tradition of paintings by the Peale family, the fruit and nuts are arranged on a bare, wood table with a dark background and strong lighting. Duncansonâ€™s composition is more elaborate than the spare, neoclassical arrangements of Raphaelle Peale (1774-1825) and closer to those by James Peale (1749-1831) and younger Peale children. In fact, Sarah Miriam Peale (1800-1885) extended the Peale influence to the West when she moved to Saint Louis in 1847. The arched format was a later, more Victorian element, however, used by SEVERIN ROESEN and many other artists of the 1850s and 1860s. Two other Duncanson still-life paintings (Detroit Institute of Arts and Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.) have similar compositional treatments and formats. However, in these two, following mid-century fashion, the still-life elements are set on a white tablecloth rather than a bare wooden table. In complexity of arrangement, the museumâ€™s still life seems to be midway between the Corcoran Gallery picture, the least complex, and that in the Detroit Institute, the most complex.  Duncanson exhibited his fruit still-life paintings at state fairs and art displays in Detroit, Cincinnati, and New York during the late 1840s and 1850s. While not all the exhibits can be definitely identified with known works, it is probable that the museumâ€™s still life was shown at one time, possibly at the Western Art Union or Detroit Gallery of Fine Arts in Firemanâ€™s Hall.', ''),

Bateman (78.3)', 'Cleopatra made Storyâ€™s reputation and set the standards for the second phase of American neoclassical sculpture. Story had planned to begin a compositional study for it during the winter of 1856-57 but only started the clay model during the winter of 1858. The carving of Cleopatra in marble was not completed until December 1860, but the statue was inscribed with only an 1858 date to commemorate the commencement of work. When he could had not attract any buyers for the work over the next several years, Story contemplated abandoning the profession. Pope Pius IX sent, at his expense, Cleopatra and Storyâ€™s Libyan Sibyl, 1860 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) to the 1862 International Exhibition in London along with several other sculptures by artists residing in Italy. Cleopatra was an immediate success, receiving favorable reviews from several newspapers and periodicals, including the London Athenaeum, which rated it, along with the Libyan Sibyl, as the most important sculpture in the exhibition. As a result, Story found a buyer for Cleopatra, a Mr. Morrison, a wealthy, provincial Englishman, who paid him three thousand pounds for it. The sculpture remained in the family, lost to public attention until 1978, when it was bought by the museum. The museumâ€™s marble is the only example of the first of three versions created by the sculptor. About 1863-64 Story created a second version by slightly altering details of the original design. Four marble examples of this second version were made in life size, each dated at the time of its sale (Daniel Grossman, Inc., New York, 1865; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1869; unlocated, formerly collection of Count Palffy, Paris, 1877; High Museum of Art, Atlanta, 1878). The one in the Metropolitan Museum of Art is the best known example of this second version. Later, in 1884, Story revised his idea a third time to design a reclining Cleopatra; it is not known if this version was ever realized in marble. The fame of Cleopatra is due not only to its reception in 1862 but also to the frequency with which the Metropolitan Museumâ€™s sculpture has been discussed and reproduced in the literature on Story; the best-known example, it has often been mistaken for the first version. The difference between the Los Angeles Museumâ€™s and the Metropolitan Museumâ€™s sculptures are subtle yet significant. They represent the sculptorâ€™s reinterpretation of the theme and his turn to a more naturalistic style, one that was favored by the second generation of neoclassical sculptors. Julian Hawthorne discussed the artistâ€™s quandary over the gesture of Cleopatraâ€™s left hand:  I remember very well the statue of Cleopatra while yet in clay . . . . Cleopatra was substantially finished, but Story was unwilling to let her go, and had no end of doubts as to the handling of minor details. The hand that rests on her knee-should the forefinger and thumb meet or be separated? If they were separated, it meant the relaxation of despair; if they met, she was still meditating defiance or revenge. After canvassing the question at great length with my father [Nathaniel Hawthornel, he decided that they should meet; but when I saw the marble statue in the Metropolitan Museum the other day I noticed that they were separated.  Hawthorne obviously saw the model for the first version in the studio: in the Los Angeles marble the thumb and forefinger are touching. Story exaggerated the relaxed posture of the figure and changed the drapery in the second version. In the Los Angeles Cleopatra the left breast is partially exposed, with the drapery hanging in an unnatural but decorous manner; in the Metropolitan Museumâ€™s example Cleopatraâ€™s left breast is fully exposed, her garment falling from her shoulder more naturally. Other differences in the details between the two versions might be attributed to the growing interest in the Near East that took place in Europe and America during the second half of the nineteenth century. In the Metropolitan Museumâ€™s figure Story gave the Egyptian queen a slightly more African physiognomy, perhaps to suggest an Eastern sensuality. Story also changed the details of the base from a simple, classical, rectangular design to one with Eastern arches.  The exoticism of Cleopatra is most obvious in the figureâ€™s jewelry and demonstrates just how typical of the nineteenth century the sculpture is. During the mid-1860s the artist had the opportunity of visiting in Paris an exhibition of ancient Egyptian jewelry and other artifacts. Although Story was praised for the authenticity of the Eastern jewelry, Cleopatraâ€™s accoutrements were a modern fabrication based on some familiarity with, but not an accurate understanding of, ancient artifacts. While Storyâ€™s figure wears the Egyptian nemes (headcloth), the cloth is not flat as in those worn by the Ptolemaic pharaohs nor is the uraeus (cobra headdress) positioned correctly. Storyâ€™s Cleopatra wears two bracelets, a snake band whose ends do not spiral in the same configuration as ancient jewelry, and a bracelet of authentic scarabs in a Victorian setting. The reworking of ancient motifs is also apparent in the chair. In his fascination with the decorative detail of other eras Story was a typically Victorian artist. Nathaniel Hawthorneâ€™s The Marble Faun (1860) was a fictionalized account of Storyâ€™s creation of the first version of Cleopatra. It and the later publication of the writerâ€™s journals were partly responsible for the sculptureâ€™s reputation. Hawthorne, who was a friend of Storyâ€™s in Rome, witnessed the creation of the statue almost from the start. Visiting Story on February 12, 1858, only fourteen days after he had commenced work on the sculpture, Hawthorne wrote in his journal, The statue of Cleopatra ... is a grand subject, and he is conceiving it with depth and power . . . . He certainly is sensible of something deeper in his art than merely to make nudities and baptize them by classic names. The type of subject matter Story preferred might have been encouraged by his friendship with Hawthorne, for like the author, Story was intrigued by heroes caught in intense psychological drama. Unlike other American neoclassical sculptors, Story was fascinated with mythical and historical heroines, such as Medea and Delilah, whose fates were determined by their personalities. Cleopatra was the first of several statues he made of such women. Story often depicted his heroines seated and brooding, inspired by the powerful seated prophet figures of Michelangelo, whom he greatly admired.  Hawthorneâ€™s admiration of Storyâ€™s abandonment of the classicized representation in favor of a more real, even terribly dangerous woman, led him to the story of the sculptor Kenyon in The Marble Faun ([Chicago: Homewood, 1861, pp. 101-3):  My new statue! said Kenyon . . . He drew away the cloth that had served to keep the moisture of his clay model from being exhaled. The sitting figure of a woman was seen. She was draped from head to foot in a costume minutely and scrupulously studied from that of ancient Egypt, as revealed by the strange sculpture of that country, its coins, drawings, painted mummy-cases, and whatever other tokens had been dug out of its pyramids, graves, and catacombs. Even the stiff Egyptian head-dress was adhered to, but had been softened into a rich feminine adornment . . . . Cleopatra sat attired in a garb proper to her historic and queenly state . . . . A marvelous repose-that rare merit in statuary . . . was diffused throughout the figure. The spectator felt that Cleopatra had sunk down out of the fever and turmoil of her life, and for one instant . . . had relinquished all activity . . . . It was the repose of despair. The face was a miraculous success. The sculptor had not shunned to give the full, Nubian lips, and other characteristics of the Egyptian physiognomy. His courage and integrity had been abundantly rewarded; for Cleopatraâ€™s beauty shone out richer, warmer, more triumphantly beyond comparison, than if, shrinking timidly from the truth, he had chosen the tame Grecian type. The expression was of profound, gloomy, heavily revolving thought. In a word, all Cleopatra-fierce, voluptuous, passionate, tender, wicked, terrible, and full of poisonous and rapturous enchantment-was kneaded into what, only a week or two before, had been a lump of wet clay from the Tiber. What a woman is this! exclaimed Miriam.', ''),

It is just as remarkable that, having modeled Nydia in 1855-56, Rogers would sell the present example as late as 1888. Although it had still been much admired at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, only a work of wide reputation and classic status would have survived the changes of taste and style that swept American sculpture during that interval. Its subject is Nydia, the virtuous, blind flower girl in Edward Bulwer-Lyttonâ€™s novel The Last Days of Pompeii, published in 1834. The sculpture recreates a moment in the story when she became separated from some friends she was attempting to lead to safety on the seashore, since in the general darkness that followed the eruption of Vesuvius her developed sense of hearing was an advantage in trying to escape the doomed city. Those familiar with the novel saw her situation in a broader sense of brave struggle against impossible odds (1835 edition, 2: 189):            Poor girl! her courage was beautiful to behold! and Fate seemed to favor one so helpless. The boiling            torrents touched her not, save by the general rain which accompanied them, the huge fragments of scoria                shivered the pavement before and beside her, but spared the frail form ....           Weak, exposed, yet fearless, supported by one wish, she was the very emblem of Psyche in her wanderings;            -- of Hope, walking through the Valley of the Shadow; a very emblem of the Soul itself -- lone but comforted,            amid the dangers and the snares of life!  In the best tradition of neoclassical sculpture Rogers sought inspiration for his subject among ancient marbles. Nydiaâ€™s bent and tentative pose may have been based on a Hellenistic copy of the Old Market Woman (example in Vatican Museum) or the group of Niobe and Her Daughters in the Uffizi in Florence. The latter may have been the source of the baroque forms of Nydiaâ€™s clinging, yet flying drapery, which, more than the fallen capital at her feet, suggests the danger faced by the helpless, wet, and wind-tossed young woman. Although Nydiaâ€™s regular facial features and the sculptureâ€™s sources in antique art are in the tradition of neoclassical sculpture, its formal extravagance, drama, and excessively sentimental literary source are departures from that tradition that, nevertheless, made it the most popular American neoclassical sculpture ever. The inscription does not include a date, but centered under the artistâ€™s name is the word Rome followed by a comma, as if the date were to be added when the piece was sold. The reason for its omission is unknown.', ''),

By 1829, when Andrew Jackson assumed the presidency, the foundations for an independent culture were securely laid. The philosopher-poet Ralph Waldo Emerson expressed the mood of the country in 1837: â€œour day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close.â€? The following decades would bring a swell of artistic creativity, focused on native themes that extolled the seemingly limitless bounty of the New World. <BR>Portraiture, and to a lesser extent history painting, continued to occupy American artists, but increasing numbers turned to views of the local countryside and its inhabitants. Although the industrial revolution only began in the United States after the War of 1812, the following three decades witnessed economic changes, especially in the north, that significantly affected working conditions, family structure, and even religion. Paintings illustrated American virtues like ingenuity and industry as well as the pleasures of country life. The new taste for genre picturesâ€?scenes of ordinary people involved in everyday activitiesâ€?seemed ideally suited to the egalitarian attitude of the Jacksonian era. <BR>This period also saw the rise of the countryâ€™s first truly national school of landscape painting, ultimately known as the Hudson River school. Its earliest, best-known exponent, Thomas Cole, sometimes painted romantic literary subjects in European settings, but his dramatic depictions of the American wilderness helped spur the popularity of American views.

An eccentric character, Hartmann was involved in such unusual ventures as the production of the first perfume concert in New York in 1902. He spent his most creative years in New York but due to asthma moved to California in the early 1920s. His health continued to deteriorate, worsened by the effects of alcohol. He became involved in the Hollywood circle of actors around John Barrymore and more importantly in the group of artists centered around the home of Margery Winter. Among the artists he met there was Ejnar Hansen, with whom he formed a long and close friendship. Hartmann thoroughly enjoyed posing for artists and during his life was painted and photographed by numerous American and foreign artists. Hansen drew, painted, and sculpted Hartmann many times. This painting is probably his best-known portrait of Hartmann. Hansen was exceptionally perceptive in conveying old age, and in all of his portraits of Hartmann the artist did not balk at making an honest portrayal. Hansen clearly depicted how greatly ill health and dissipation had aged Hartmann. Yet Hansen was also very sympathetic to the man whom many in Los Angeles considered a mere caricature of what he had been. Hansen continued to convey Hartmannâ€™s intelligence, even entitling one of his portraits The Old Philosopher, 1940 (estate of the artist as of 1965). In the museumâ€™s portrait Hartmann thoughtfully sits next to a table full of books, as if he has paused to contemplate what he has just read. With his hand to his head, Hartmann appears in the traditional pose of the thinker. The soft light filtering through the interior and the delicate browns, grays, and oranges create a protective, mellow atmosphere around the tired Hartmann.

Although Autumn Landscape has an inscription on the stretcher dating it to 1926, the paintingâ€™s style is more like that of his landscapes of 1921-23. The cubic structure of the houses suggests the influence of CÃ©zanne and Picasso. The rich palette and exuberant brushwork reveal the impact of more contemporary art. Matulka may have known of the art of Franz Marc (1880-1916), yet it is more likely that landscapes such as Autumn Landscape were informed by the post World War I School of Paris, in particular, artists such as Roger de la Fresnaye (1885-1925) who were active in Paris when Matulka lived in that city. The brilliant hues-clear yellows, oranges, and russets, and bold blues and greens-are more allied with the second generation cubists than with Picasso himself. Critics commented on the vibrance of Matulkaâ€™s palette when this painting was exhibited in his first solo exhibition. Also seen in this and other landscapes shown in that 1927 exhibit is Matulkaâ€™s overwhelming love of movement: not only did he often use the motif of a sweeping road to lead the viewer into his scenes, he also enlivened his surfaces with patches of flickering color that almost contradict the solidity of the forms. Although the brilliant autumnal colors might suggest a New England locale, an area in which Matulka is known to have summered during the mid-1920s, the site may have been in France or Czechoslovakia. A partially erased inscription on the frame indicates Provence as the locale. For Matulka landscapes were personal reminiscences of places he knew intimately.', ''),

Few details of the painting support that identification, however, whereas many coincide with the story of Cymon and Iphigenia, which West may have known either from the original tale by Boccaccio in The Decameron (1353) or from the version by John Dryden (1700). Cymon was the handsome son of a nobleman of Cypress who was so crude and stupid that he was sent to work on the land. One morning he happened on the camp where Iphigenia (not the daughter of Agamemnon) was sleeping among her slaves. Transfixed by her beauty, he remained leaning on his staff. When she awoke and spoke, he continued to stare at her. His love for Iphigenia fired Cymon with such desire for learning that he quickly advanced to become an exemplary young man and after some military adventures, won her. All the elements in this painting correspond to the story, with the exception that Iphigenia is here clothed, whereas in most representations she is sleeping nearly nude, with her breasts uncovered. A reference to this detail is made by the partial dress of the sleeping slave on the right.  The museumâ€™s picture and Westâ€™s Isaacâ€™s Servant Tying the Bracelet on Rebeccaâ€™s Arm, 1775 (Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Conn.), dated two years later and of identical size, were painted for John Hobart, the second earl of Buckinghamshire, and exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1776. The theme shared by these otherwise dissimilar subjects is the finding of the ideal wife. It would have been entirely characteristic of West to have painted these pictures, with their similar central female figures, as allegorical portraits, in this case of Lord Buckinghamshireâ€™s second wife, whom he had married in 1770. The fact that they were inherited by the daughter from this marriage would seem to support this conjecture. If Iphigenia is a portrait of the countess, perhaps this explains her modestly covered bosom.  In his well-known works of the mid-1760s West continued to develop his somewhat dry and stiff neoclassical style. By the early 1770s he had arrived at a truly grand style: the forms are simpler and larger, colors richer, technique more expert and elegant. The large forms, heavy drapery, and slow rhythms recall the classicism of the Italian seventeenth-century artists Guercino (1591-1666) and Guido Reni (1575-1642).', ''),

Although most of the male figures have distinctive physiognomies, Stewartâ€™s social world was so large encompassing not only Americans but those of many nationalities-that identification is difficult. The art historian Sue Carson Joyner has suggested that the male standing on the far right is a self-portrait. Stewart usually idealized his female figures, giving them handsome, aristocratic profiles, so the similarities among female figures in his paintings can be misleading.  The painting was probably not a specific commission, for Stewart was too wealthy to need such work, nor would he have offered it for sale if it were. The painting probably records the baptism of a friendâ€™s child, indicated by the faint inscription of a day and time on the back of the painting, but was not intended to record the event for the public. The Baptism was the culmination of Stewartâ€™s development of elaborate multifigured scenes; thereafter he limited his compositions to smaller groupings.  Although the identities of the people remain an enigma, the painting can be appreciated on its own terms. It is a tour de force of technical skill and a prime example of late nineteenth-century academic aesthetics. The persuasiveness of Stewartâ€™s depiction of natural light suggests the fascination with outdoor effects that were just emerging in his art. The picture met with great acclaim at an international exposition held in Berlin in 1895. The realistic illusion of the rich damask wall coverings, the silk, satin, and lace trim of the figuresâ€™ attire, and the soft, delicately rendered skin of the women and children captivate viewers even today.', ''),

Third Avenue El illustrates the crowded conditions of the New York elevated trains but does not give a sense of the extreme congestion often experienced by the daily passenger. This is somewhat surprising since Marsh delighted in the hustle and bustle of urban crowds, but his depictions of buses and trains lack the raucous quality of his other New York images. They are quieter and more serious. By focusing on a few figures and presenting them as physically and psychologically separated-as in Second Avenue El, 1929 (formerly Frank K. M. Rehn Galleries, New York), and Why Not Use the L? 1930 (Whitney Museum of American Art, New York) -- he demonstrated how those who live in a large, crowded city could feel alone. Although the passengers in Third Avenue El sit close together, they remain isolated from each other. The obvious source of Marshâ€™s painting is Third Class Carriage, c. 1860-70 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), by HonorÃ© Daumier (1808-1879), a work that he could have known through any one of several painted and lithographed versions or through reproductions, which were numerous. Marsh not only borrowed the composition of this well-known image, he shared the French masterâ€™s appreciation of the dignity and worth of working-class people. Each passenger is a large, statuesque figure with a monumental presence. Marsh painted Third Avenue El in his characteristic, thin tempera wash, drawing in many details, such as the facial features and fur collars and cuffs. Deep colors, transparent washes, opaque passages, and drawing describe the solid forms. Based on various inscriptions in more than one hand on the stretcher, the museumâ€™s painting has been dated to both 1930 and 1931 and at times referred to as Second Avenue El. According to the artistâ€™s own detailed records in his notebook however, this painting was created during January 1931 and titled Third Avenue El. A number of drawings and an etching are related to the painting. Drawing was essential to Marshâ€™s art, and he felt that the print medium aided the development of his painting. The related print was probably created after the painting. Art historian Norman Sasowsky dates the etching to 1930, but according to records the artist kept of the states of his etchings, he first executed states of the print sometime between January and March 1931. Marsh made a major change in the print, substituting a black man for the white woman in the center foreground. Marsh had included blacks in the painted scene, as two female figures in the near background. Perhaps by giving a black a more prominent position in the print, the most important position in fact, Marsh felt he was updating Daumierâ€™s image. It is not clear when in the evolution of the related images Marsh changed the figure from a woman to a man. The female figure in the painting has a masculine appearance despite her fox-trimmed coat and handbag. Such ambiguity of gender is present in a number of related drawings. Marsh carried a sketch pad wherever he went, and in several drawings there are jottings of figure groupings and scenes similar to the painting Third Avenue El. Despite the sketchy nature of the drawings, in one in sketchbook 130 (Archiv. Am. Art, Reginald Marsh Papers, microfilm roll NRM8, fr. 583) Marsh so reworked the head of the center figure that its sex cannot be conclusively determined.', ''),

Sullyâ€™s Register of Pictures indicates that he painted The Gypsy Girl for Carey for a price of three hundred dollars, designing it in England before beginning it in Philadelphia on February 24, 1839, and finishing it there on September 9, 1839. In an apparent contradiction Sullyâ€™s journal entry for January 25, 1839, indicates that he began ... England. Sully is best known as a portraitist, but of the more than twenty-six hundred paintings he made, nearly six hundred were genre and thematic paintings, what he called fancy pictures. Of these, more than two dozen were of peasant children like this gypsy girl, a subject that appealed very much to early Victorian taste and the purchasers of the periodâ€™s elaborately illustrated gift books. The Gypsy Girl appeared in the 1842 volume of The Gift: A Christmas and New Yearâ€™s Present as an engraved illustration for Charles West Thomsonâ€™s poem The Gipsyâ€™s Chaunt. Sullyâ€™s register records other paintings of gypsy Children, some made as early as 1828, and drawings survive. However, the specific inspiration for Sullyâ€™s The Gypsy Girl, the Hints obtained in England, may have been A Gipsy Girl, 1794 (Royal Academy of Arts, London), the diploma picture of Sir Thomas Lawrence (1769-1830), which Sully would have had a chance to see in London at the Royal Academy of Arts. Known to his admirers as the American Lawrence, Sully was a great admirer of the English artists as the dramatic style of his own The Gypsy Girl attests, in its dramatic contrasts, flowing lines and rich, warm color.', ''),

The theatrical scene expresses the artistâ€™s new interest in contemporary urban life, first demonstrated in Bootleggers, 1927 (Reynolda House, Museum of American Art, Winston-Salem, North Carolina) and expanded in America Today. Benton was fond of depicting burlesque dancers and strippers and wrote nostalgically of a Fourteenth Street theater where the strippers used to make the old boys drool at the mouth and keep their hands in their pockets (An Artist in America, p. 269). The burlesque dancer -- with her vigorously thrusting elbow, head, and buttocks -- is similar in gesture to the cavorting performer in the upper-right corner of the City Activities panel in the America Today mural. In the finished mural Benton omitted the audience since all the mural images are only fragmentary scenes, one overlapping another, arranged to convey the hustle and bustle of twentieth-century American life. While Benton presented a more complete view of a theater in Burlesque, the easel painting shares with the mural panels a similar compositional approach: the theater interior is arranged in segmented groupings, the stage, orchestra, balcony, and boxes conceived as irregular shapes that fit together. Moreover, the large, arcing forms of the stage and balcony in the museumâ€™s painting echo the decorative molding that divides various scenes in the mural.', ''),

Indeed, the modernist elements found in A Song continued to influence his art even after his study of the Renaissance masters had led him toward a very deliberate classicism. As a young man he had admired the styles of Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841-1919), Claude Monet (1840-1926), Paul CÃ©zanne (1839-1906), and other French painters. His overriding interest in the effects of light and color-which was derived from the impressionists and proved to be the foundation of his technique as a painter -- can be readily detected in A Song. From the works of CÃ©zanne, whom he acknowledged as the source for his lifelong enthusiasm for still life, Brackman derived the use of rich color for modeling, faceted forms, tilted tabletops, and a balance of two-dimensional and threedimensional elements. With its strong color, disorienting perspective, and boisterous energy, A Song reflects these influences more directly than his better known, more classical works. The singerâ€™s shirt and the samovar may refer to the artistâ€™s Russian origins, but because of the singerâ€™s expression and the angle of his face it is difficult to determine whether the painting was intended as a self-portrait. The combination of a seminude figure with a still life in a studio setting was to become a familiar Brackman theme. A Song was one of numerous paintings by Brackman owned by the music publisher Irving Mills, an early patron. The inscriptions on the canvas and its verso may be by different hands. The last digit in the date on the front is ambiguous, suggesting 3, 5, or 6. A review of Brackmanâ€™s 1926 exhibition at Babcock Galleries in New York definitely identifies this painting as The Song. Given the prominence of the samovar, however, it is possible that the painting may have been exhibited the year before as The Samovar in his one-man show at the Milch Galleries.', '');

Wyant depicted a desolate land, devoid of any human presence, with only one tree sturdy enough to survive, and the painting was mistakenly referred to in 1912 as No Manâ€™s Land. Storm clouds move quickly over the wild marshy land, solitary stream, and ragged rocks, which cast threatening, dark shadows. While Wyant was preoccupied with light, atmosphere, and weather, Any Man''''s Land is one of his stormiest landscapes. His earth-toned palette has become even more somber, and his colors--browns, yellow ochers, grays, dark greens, blacks, and white--serve as visual equivalents of nature''''s ominous mood. The loose brushwork in the artist''''s late paintings is usually attributed to the physical disability he suffered after his stroke. Any Man''''s Land, however, demonstrates that Wyant''''s late painterly handling was not a result of technical inability but was deliberately employed as an expressive element. The forceful strokes in the clouds and sky echo the movement of the threatening storm, and the vigorous scumbling of the rocks and distant terrain express the wildness of the land. Air and earth seem to merge as the wind whips through, and all becomes ethereal. So removed from strict representation had Wyant become that his art verged on abstraction. Wyant''''s brushwork and emphasis on mood rather than place would date this as a late work. The art historian Robert S. Olpin places it in the artist''''s last years, dating it about 1887-92. A painting with the same title was exhibited in the 1880 annual exhibition of the Society of American Artists, however, and the notices the exhibited landscape received in several newspaper reviews accord with the appearance of the museum''''s painting. Any Man''''s Land therefore was painted much earlier than previously considered and demonstrates that Wyant''''s turn toward a personal, abstract art began earlier than art historians previously thought.', ''),

In Execution the entire image points to the unseen murderer.

The manâ€™s constricted, bound body has been compressed into the shape of a sack.

Mickiewicz (M.81.182)', 'Elizabeth Alexander (1867-1947) was the daughter of James W. Alexander, who was introduced to John White Alexander by Joseph Harper because of the similarity of their names. Elizabeth and John were married in 1887, and the following year their only child, James, was born. Elizabeth was an educated, attractive woman who enjoyed the company of her husbandâ€™s circle of painters and writers.  This portrait of her was painted in Alexanderâ€™s New York studio late in 1902 and immediately included in his exhibition at Durand-Ruelâ€™s galleries held in late November. It was one of the favorites of the exhibition, commended for its subdued color, flowing line, and grace. The portrait demonstrates Alexanderâ€™s mature style as it developed from his symbolist days in Paris. It is an evocative figure study in which mood and atmosphere take precedence over frank likeness. The portrait was painted in a palette of muted pinks and moss green -- the artistâ€™s favorite colors -- on a coarse, loosely woven, absorbent canvas to produce a soft, hazy effect. Alexander cast his wife in a somewhat ambiguous, shadowy outdoor setting with dramatic spotlighting on her face and right hand. The strong light shining from below, which first appeared in Alexanderâ€™s early theatrical portraits of the 1880s, reappeared in his paintings of the late 1890s. Such lighting seems quite appropriate for a portrait of Elizabeth Alexander, for she not only shared her husbandâ€™s interest in the theater, she also collaborated closely with him on costume and lighting designs and, after his death , made a distinguished career in the theatrical arts. The shadowy illumination heightens the quiet sense of mystery which pervades the best of Alexanderâ€™s mature figure paintings.  Despite her quite independent nature -- in the 1910s she became active in the womenâ€™s suffrage movement -- Mrs. Alexander was portrayed by her husband as a fragile beauty. Her billowing gown forms a gentle flowing line, echoing the curves of her hat and the shadowy trees and clouds in the background. Alexander was deeply interested in late nineteenth-century theories regarding the psychology of line, and in the 1890s he began to compose paintings of elegant women in terms of sensuous, curving shapes. His fascination with emotive line caused Alexander to become increasingly bold, and by the early twentieth century he was creating paintings in which the figures and their dresses form daringly abstract compositions of exaggerated line and flat patterns.  Elizabeth Alexander often posed for her husband; between 1893 and 1902 he painted at least five portraits of her. This is one of the largest compositions identified as her portrait. Its size, as well as the full length of the figure and the presence of a balustrade -- a traditional motif of eighteenth-century portraits set in gardens -- places the painting within the grandmanner portrait tradition. When the painting was first publicly displayed, critics commented on its English landscape setting and Mrs. Alexanderâ€™s old fashioned gown, noting that it recalled the work of Thomas Gainsborough (1727-1788).  After the artistâ€™s death the portrait was included in numerous memorial exhibitions, usually with the title On a Balcony. By 1939 when it was included in an exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, the painting had become confused with another full-length portrait of Mrs. Alexander, one dated 1894 and sometimes referred to as Changeable Taffeta (estate of the artist as of 1985). Consequently much of the subsequent literature on Alexander has included a date much too early for this painting and also incorrect exhibition and literature documentation.', ''),

He appears to have received almost all of the most important portrait commissions in the Midwestern cities where he worked. Nevertheless, he exhibited genre paintings at the National Academy of Design in 1842 and with the American Art-Union in 1846 and 1848-49. The Young Mechanic, his Art-Union painting for 1848, is the first of these efforts to come to light. Its warm tonality, strong lighting, and detailed realism accord with the artistâ€™s portrait style during the period. The thoroughgoing realism is epitomized in the trompe lâ€™oeil feature of the gate that extends forward toward the picture plane and which bears Smithâ€™s signature. His attention to detail and textures seems almost obsessive, even in the context of Midwestern taste as displayed in the realism of Cincinnatiâ€™s Lilly Martin Spencer (1822-1902) and JAMES H. BEARD early in the following decade. Smithâ€™s is a frank realism of wear, stains, and clutter, held together by a strong architectural framework. The title, The Young Mechanic (the word mechanic meaning a skilled person who works with his hands), refers to the boy seated behind the counter of what may be his fatherâ€™s woodworking shop. The working-class boy has been hired by the better-dressed boy in the straw hat to whittle a new mast for his toy boat.', ''),

A Matter of Opinion is a standard Rogers composition: three figures are arranged symmetrically and convey the story through their poses and expressions. The sculptor described his humorous representation as a consultation of physicians over an invalid lady-which results in an evident disagreement. One physician, taking the womanâ€™s pulse, gives his opinion, while the other, obviously indignant over the diagnosis, reacts by glaring at his opponent and buttoning his coat to leave.

The highly varied palette of deep hues contributes to the paintingâ€™s rich elegance. Kirkâ€™s tabletop arrangements were in the tradition of the work of Paul CÃ©zanne (1839-1906) but took on a rigidly standardized format.

Turnerâ€™s mentor in Europe, Currier, was the most active still-life painter among the Americans in Munich and may have inspired Turner to attempt to work in that genre. Turner sent two still-life paintings from Munich to the Society of American Artistsâ€™ annual in 1880. Of those known today, closest to the museumâ€™s paintings is Still Life with Swords, 1880 (with Childâ€™s Gallery, Boston), which bears the inscription Munich 80. Although more finished, it shares the warm background and extremely oblong format of Hollyhocks and its concentration of incident at one end of the painting.  In an article on composition in 1896 (The Art Interchange 36 [February 1896]: 34) Turner praised oriental art, and Japanese motifs had appeared in his work by the mid-1880s. Although a consciousness of Japanese design is not generally associated with Munich in the 1870s, Hollyhocksâ€™ narrow, vertical format and flat, decorative arrangement of leaves and flowers against a lighter, somewhat golden background suggest that Turner was already aware of Japanese art and decorative concerns. The unfinish of the roughed-in lower half of the canvas also anticipates the tendency to simplification and reduction, which is seen-and was commented upon-in Turnerâ€™s later still, life compositions. However, decorative, vertical still-life paintings with light backgrounds by the Austrian artist Hans Makart (1840-1884) are known. One of the outstanding students of the Munich academy in the 1860s, Makart continued to exert a strong influence on decorative painting in Munich even after his removal to Vienna.', ''),

Foggy, nocturnal, and twilight scenes in which subdued light suppressed details, flattened space, and reduced the range of color to a dominant tonality were characteristic of his early work in Los Angeles. Although many of his paintings are undated, it seems that Redmond continued the tonal style throughout much of his career alongside the brightly colored impressionist scenes that he began to paint about 1912 and for which he is known today. In an interview in 1931 Redmond complained that he preferred to paint pictures of solitude and silence but could only sell poppy fields (in Millier, Our Artists in Person). The distinctness of the brushstrokes, uniform in length and direction, creating a tapestrylike quality similar to that in the museumâ€™s California Poppy Field, c. 1926, suggests that Landscape was painted later in Redmondâ€™s career, after the formation of his mature style.

He was so struck by the visual image of laundry dancing on clotheslines strung between the upper stories of tenement buildings and the activity of the inhabitants crowding the streets of the poor sections of the city that in the early 1920s he created a series devoted to the theme of wash day. Pushcart Vendors is one of the major paintings from the series. Grabach added to the view of clean white laundry fluttering in the wind an array of peddlers selling their wares from portable pushcarts. The locale was identified as New York when it was exhibited in 1924. Grabach was close friends with GEORGE LUKS and acquainted with the urban scenes of the Ash Can painters, and his paintings of lower-class New York neighborhoods were no doubt inspired by their example. As did the Ash Can artists, Grabach created an image of lower-class city life without an element of dreariness, one characterized by constant activity and energy. A decade separates Grabachâ€™s street scenes from those of the original Ash Can painters, however. Grabach, reflecting his earlier impressionist and postimpressionist concerns, showed a greater interest in the decorative quality of images. Unlike GEORGE BELLOWS in his Cliff Dwellers, 1913 (LACMA; q.v.), Grabach viewed the city from above, from a distance that prevented the artist and now the viewer from becoming immersed in the activity below. This high vantage point also led the artist to flatten the view, to literally pile the alleyways and buildings one on top of another rather than depicting the scene in depth. The two-dimensionality of the scene was further enhanced by the canvasâ€™s high horizon line and almost square format. Grabach utilized formal devices that create the impression of liveliness, and he often incorporated diagonals into his compositions to intensify the sense of movement. In Pushcart Vendors the entire scene is set on an angle, with the wall that separates the buildings from the street functioning as the major diagonal. The wash on the clotheslines forms a counterpoint to the alley and buildings, thereby activating the densely packed scene. Grabach also used a greater variety of colors with less concern for pseudoscientific theory than did Bellows in Cliff Dwellers. Buildings are red, blue, white, and brown, the distant sky lavender, and a patch of grass sparkling green, and these colors flicker across the scene.', ''),

It was the presidentâ€™s suggestion that Saint-Gaudens should adopt in his designs the exceptionally high relief and raised rims of the ancient models. He corresponded with the sculptor frequently during the fall of that year to review design details. The design for the twenty-dollar gold piece was revised three times. Although the position of the eagle on the reverse changed from standing to flying, the obverse remained close to Saint-Gaudensâ€™s original concept of a figure striding forward as if on a mountaintop, a living thing and typical of progress. Differences of opinion with the mint officials regarding the practicality of the high relief delayed the minting until after the sculptorâ€™s death. At the presidentâ€™s insistence a small number of experimental, extra-high-relief versions of the twenty-dollar coin were struck, and then an edition of high-relief coins was minted. Because these high-relief coins had to be struck on a medal press, rather than a regular coin press, and because they would not stack, Charles E. Barber (1842-1917), the mint engraver, then modeled a coin in flat relief and changed the date from Roman numerals to the Arabic 1907. The museumâ€™s coin is part of the regular issue in high relief, put into circulation in December 1907, before the Barber-modified final issue. Saint-Gaudensâ€™s ten- and twenty-dollar coins generally have been considered the most artistic ever produced in the United States.

Young American students still traveled to Europe, especially Paris, for their initiation to art, but the progressive new ideas of cubism, futurism, and surrealism that they imbibed only found their true home in the United States. <BR>As demonstrated by the first generation of modernists in the circle of Alfred Stieglitz, American artists rarely abandoned referential ties to the physical world completely. The simplification of form, multiple perspectives, and ideas about the fourth dimension that radical proponents of cubism espoused would find their most compelling American expressions in the fishermen of Marsden Hartley, and the animal bones and skulls of Georgia Oâ€™Keeffe. To these artists, abstraction meant the synthesis of personal experience. <BR>The introduction of psychological ideas, first in the form of Sigmund Freudâ€™s discussion of the unconscious and later in the writings and art of the surrealists, found an enthusiastic audience in America. Such new concepts not only expanded ideas about the human mind but also encouraged the liberation of social conduct, in particular, sexual mores. Women increasingly became involved in creative aspects of the new modern age. In 1934 the Los Angeles artists Helen Lundeberg and Lorser Feitelson issued the only surrealist manifesto to appear in the United States, thereby demonstrating that in a relatively short time California had seriously challenged New York as the leader of the brave new world.', ''),

Speicher first saw Moore, who was nicknamed Red because of his red hair and formidable moustache, swinging a hammer in his blacksmith shop and was so struck by his exceptional physical presence that he persuaded Moore to pose for him. Eventually Moore became one of Speicherâ€™s favorite models, sitting for him every year for five years, but only in the autumn after the farming and hunting seasons. What resulted was a series of drawings and paintings in which the artist was able to convey the strength and ruggedness of this modern version of Longfellowâ€™s Village Blacksmith, as one critic referred to him. Speicher usually depicted the brawny Moore wearing work clothes-a rough shirt, pants, and heavy shoes-characteristic of the rural American laborer. (Speicher thought of him as an independent son of the soil.) He placed Moore in interior settings natural for him, often with different implements indicative of his manly activities: an anvil and wheel for this blacksmith scene, a gun for the painting of Moore as a hunter, and a table laden with food for the image of Moore as a farmer. A restrained palette was typical of Speicher, and here the choice of browns was exceptionally well suited for underscoring the rugged, masculine quality of the image. Further conveying Mooreâ€™s physical power is his assertive gesture of crossing his muscular arms over his broad chest. The painting was exhibited in several major American cities during the mid-1930s, winning awards that confirmed Speicherâ€™s being one of the most important figure painters of the day. Although his approach to the figure was conservative, Speicherâ€™s handling was that of a modernist, for he built form with a soft, but square, planar and economical brushstroke. The artist was commended for this direct painting in a review of the Whitney Biennial. Speicher painted another version of Moore as a blacksmith (see Related Works). His reason for creating this other version is not known nor is the chronology. The two blacksmith paintings were the only images of Moore that Speicher made as full-length figures, and they are among the most monumental of his images. Speicherâ€™s romantic conception of such rural American figures seems to be midway between the classicism of academic painting and American regionalism.', ''),

They always contain the same basic components: a wood table that is tilted toward the viewer, and often draped with some fabric, with an array of objects atop it. An assortment of fruit, arranged around and on plates or in other containers, was usually placed near a potted plant or vase of flowers, as in Still Life with Carafe. After the 1910s McFeeâ€™s still lifes often featured a glass object, no doubt because the reflective and transparent qualities of the glass enabled him to explore his modernist fascination with forms and planes. The faceted, cut-glass decanter in the museumâ€™s painting seems to have been especially appealing to the artist, for he used it in several other still lifes of the 1930s. The arrangement in the museumâ€™s painting is slightly more elaborate than in most of his other compositions, since, following an old still-life tradition, McFee presented both whole and cut fruit. He also included in the background of this painting a second table with books placed on it. Although McFeeâ€™s still-life compositions of his mature years appear more traditional than his early abstractions, they continue to demonstrate the artistâ€™s fundamental loyalty to Paul CÃ©zanne (1839-1906). In the use of a simple table, the type of still-life arrangement, and an emphasis on cubic form, McFee followed CÃ©zanneâ€™s example, but he gave a greater sense of depth to the overall scene. His mature still lifes also reveal his personal exploration of painting techniques. As did Dasburg, McFee presented his objects not in flat, opaque planes but in layers of delicately brushed pigments that give a soft, almost shimmering quality to his surfaces. The objects appear both solid and delicate. In Still Life with Carafe the overall gray tonality is infused with a wealth of other colors-deep green, alizarin, warm brown, and orange-that are repeated throughout. The overall appearance of a McFee painting is one of great sensuality.', ''),

Gelfand (M.84.198)', 'As a guest in 1871 of the official government survey team led by Ferdinand Hayden, Moran explored the headwaters of the Yellowstone River and became the first professional artist to paint the area. While he was out in the field, Moran worked in pencil and watercolor. These watercolor field sketches were used to influence Congress in its decision to declare the Yellowstone area Americaâ€™s first national park. On his return to Philadelphia at the end of the summer of 1871 Moran produced a series of highly finished watercolors, which became his best-known early images of the Yellowstone. Contemporaneously dated oil paintings of Yellowstone by Moran are rare, and only three from 1872 have been documented: the museumâ€™s painting, an unlocated The Tower Falls, and The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. The last is perhaps Moranâ€™s best known, having been bought by Congress soon after its exhibition in Washington in 1872. Hot Springs of the Yellowstone was only recently discovered and did not receive critical attention in either the nineteenth or twentieth century. The exact month in which Moran painted it is not known; it may have been created before or after The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. Moran depicted the main terrace of Mammoth Hot Springs in the Wyoming Territory, just south of what is today the Wyoming-Montana state line. The Hayden group spent three days in late July 1871 exploring the springs, and Moranâ€™s watercolors express their enthusiasm for the unusual geology of the area. Hayden noted, The scenery in the vicinity of these hot springs is varied and beautiful beyond description (The Wonders of the West-II, Scribnerâ€™s Monthly 3 [February 1872]: 391). In the meticulously rendered foreground details Moran showed the hot springs and unusual travertine terraces, geological formations which were not well known in the East. Hot springs tend to be concentrated along drainage basins of lakes and streams, and Moranâ€™s delineation of a lake in the broad plain of the middle distance is faithful to geological principles. The streams that feed into the lake eat away at the rock as the water, rich in minerals, filters through limestone crevices. Even his dabbing style of brushwork mirrors the cauliflowerlike appearance of sulfur deposits. The entire scene is conveyed in the vibrant palette typical of Moranâ€™s watercolors: salmon, yellow, sulphur, onyx, and a bit of green. The intense hues, although seemingly exaggerated, realistically present the extraordinary colors that the rocks take on from the sulfur, sodium, and other minerals in the water. When he originally transcribed this view of the hot springs, Moran was looking south toward what is now known as Bunsen Peak, which rises near the Gardiner River. Although the high mountain visible in the distance can be identified as Bunsen Peak, Moran took liberties with its profile. The entire distant area, with its soft opalescent atmosphere and rainbow, is idealized. The romanticized view suggests that Moran intended the painting to be an exhibition piece rather than a highly developed preparatory study. In many respects Hot Springs of the Yellowstone reflects the influence of Turner. In his early paintings the English artist had demonstrated an exactitude to nature which John Ruskin had extolled while in his later canvases he evinced a romanticism in his use of a brilliant palette and powerful sense of vortex. Moranâ€™s landscape has all these elements.', ''),

Pumas and other large cats were Putnamâ€™s favorite subjects, usually rendered, as here, as immensely powerful creatures with heavy, muscular limbs. In Puma and Deer the surging form of the puma is contrasted with that of the limp, lifeless deer carried across its back. Because of their vigorous modeling and lack of finish, Putnamâ€™s works greatly appealed to modernists. Little information concerning the bronzes cast by the different foundries used by Putnam is available. The museumâ€™s cast has no foundry mark, but it does bear a copyright date of 1912. Putnam was associated with Macbeth Gallery in New York from 1908 to 1917 (Archiv. Am. Art, Macbeth Gallery Papers, Putnam-Gallery Correspondence, 1908-13, and Artistsâ€™ Credit Books, 1910-18, not on microfilm), and for part of that time, from at least 1911 to 1914, used Roman Bronze Works to cast his bronzes (New York, Roman Bronze Works, Ledgers, unpaginated). A cast of Puma and Deer in the Oakland Museum bears a Roman Bronze foundry mark and a different version of the copyright inscription, so it would appear the museumâ€™s cast does not belong to the same edition. In 1913 Putnam induced his brother-in-law, Frederick Storey, to resume casting in their own foundry, with Putnam helping with the retouching and patination of the bronzes. Apparently with an interruption during the First World War, they continued to produce bronzes until early in 1918. Bronzes marked with the name Putnam and Storey Foundry are known, but it is not known whether all were so marked. During the war Rodin arranged for a foundry in Paris to make casts from Putnamâ€™s plasters for exhibition at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in 1915, but these casts have not been identified. In 1921 Mrs. Adolph Spreckels, who with her husband helped found the California Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco, bought fifty-five plasters from the artist for the express purpose of having them cast by Alexis Rudier in his Paris foundry, whose mark they bear. Two sets were made, and Mrs. Spreckels gave one to the California Palace of the Legion of Honor (now part of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco) and the other to the Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego (now the San Diego [Calif.] Museum of Art).', ''),

By 1920 more than half of the countryâ€™s population lived in urban areas. Seeming to guarantee employment, the cities lured many farmers and African Americans from rural areas. In addition, between 1900 and 1920, 14.5 million immigrants from Europe, Russia, Mexico, and Asia settled here, primarily in urban centers. A new energy was channeled to such cities as New York and Chicago, as massive skyscrapers were erected to furnish much-needed office space and living quarters. Even West Coast cities were affectedâ€?the population of Los Angeles tripled between 1900 and 1910; its unplanned urban sprawl and dizzying speed were captured in the zany movies of the Keystone Cops, filmed on the streets of the city. <BR>Art reflected these changing social and economic dynamics. Impressionism and postimpressionism were still popular. Yet other, more progressive ideas now challenged artists. A strong new commitment to realism emerged in literature and the fine arts. <BR>In Philadelphia and New York, a group of artists centered around Robert Henri captured the vitality of urban American life. These realists depicted the hustle and bustle of city streets, the common pleasures of restaurants and various forms of entertainment. Critics dubbed these realists the â€œash can schoolâ€? because of their treatment of unidealized subject matter previously considered unattractive. The realists focused on the inhabitants of cities rather than the cities themselves. Their interest in people also led the m t o create a significant number of single-figure paintings, conveying the human side of the new America . During the 1910s and 1920s the realist celebration of America spread throughout the country, as artists recorded the neighborhoods and people that made their own cities distinct.', ''),

Until he moved back to New Jersey in 1915, he devoted much of his time to painting winter landscapes -- possibly inspired by the snowy scenes of JOHN TWACHTMAN -- that were well received at the National Academy of Design annuals. During the late nineteenth century artists had begun using such images as a means to explore the potential of the color white, but by Grabachâ€™s time such interest was more of a decorative nature. In true impressionist fashion Grabach found much color in the snowy image: a setting sun casts a golden orange on the rooftops, while cooler pastels of green and lavender describe the shadows. The impastoed brushwork is somewhat controlled in the delineation of the forms of the houses, but looser for the field of snow. The canvas is an exact square, a format popular with early twentieth-century impressionists and post-impressionists, as were a high viewpoint and brushwork that served to emphasize the picture plane. The buildings and yards are read as flat shapes in a jigsaw-puzzle arrangement. As Sunlit Houses is a view of a town, it foreshadows Grabachâ€™s later urban images and probably was done just before he left Greenfield.', ''),

The previous year Hesselius had obtained the prestigious commission to paint the portraits of the four children of Benedict Calvert, 1761 (Baltimore Museum of Art). Having begun his career under the stylistic influence of Robert Feke, he had by this point come under the influence of John Wollaston (active 1736-1767), who then was working in the mid-Atlantic region.  In his mature work a sculptural feeling for clear forms and volumes recalls the work of Feke. The head, for instance, is isolated as a distinct form, high on a thin neck, its shapes slightly simplified and clarified. The heavy, lidded, almond eyes betray the example of Wollaston, as do the decorative elaboration of lace and extensive patterning of highlights in the drapery. More his own is Hesseliusâ€™s use of strong color, in this case a brilliant blue in the dress and bright pink in the shawl, echoed in the high color of the face. The museumâ€™s painting is exceptionally well preserved for the work of Hesselius and consequently unusually impressive.  The subject was born in 1742 or 1743, the daughter of Samuel Chew III of Anne Arundel County and his wife Sarah Lock. The museumâ€™s painting is one of four portraits of members of the Chew family executed by Hesselius in 1762. One is a portrait of Elizabethâ€™s mother, another is of Elizabethâ€™s brother, Samuel Lloyd Chew (both unlocated), and the fourth is another version of the portrait of Elizabeth (Brooklyn Museum). The other version is smaller (28 3/8 x 25 1/8 inches), and only a bust-length, with Elizabeth Smith wearing a silver dress, with blue bow, and chocolate-colored shawl and holding a sprig of flowers in a slightly different gesture. In 1939 the museumâ€™s painting was the only one of this group of four not in the collection of Samuel Claggett Chew of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. The fact that the museumâ€™s painting descended through Mrs. Smithâ€™s family rather than the Chew family suggests the possibility that it was commissioned separately by Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Since Elizabeth Chew was married on February 11, 1762, it is possible that the present painting was a marriage portrait. Her first husband was John Hamilton Smith, a resident and plantation owner of Calvert County; they had two daughters, Elizabeth Chew and Mary. Her half-sister, Mary, married a Dr. Alexander Hamilton Smith in 1767. (There was a prominent Scottish physician of the same name living in Annapolis in the 1740s.) Records for Saint Jamesâ€™s (Old Herring Creek) Parish show a large family with the name of Smith living there in the early eighteenth century. Elizabeth Chew Smith later married a man named Sprigg. It is not known whether this second marriage produced issue. She died sometime after 1800.', ''),

As it happened, Ball finished that bust (Boston Athenaeum) just two days before Websterâ€™s death on October 24, 1852. It naturally attracted considerable attention, and Ball soon had orders for nearly a hundred casts of it. Declared to be a faithful likeness, it was the model for all of Ballâ€™s subsequent sculptures of Webster. His next project was a small full-length sculpture of the same subject, his first attempt at the full figure. His inexperience with armatures caused the first to tip over and crash to the floor. Managing to salvage the figureâ€™s head, he began again. The resulting sculpture was an immediate success. On the first day Ball exhibited it, he received an offer of five hundred dollars for the sculpture and the right to reproduce it. Ball later remarked that the shrewd art dealer, C. W. Nichols, must have made five thousand dollars out of it. Presumably Ball received a more appropriate sum from Nichols when he also assigned to him the patent for the companion figure of Henry Clay that the artist completed in 1858, shortly after returning to Boston from his Italian sojourn. Ball felt it was not as successful as his statuette of Webster, but Senator Edward Everett wrote a letter in praise of its fidelity, both in likeness and the carriage of the figure, and most today would find the statuette produced by the more experienced sculptor to have a greater delicacy of line and a more convincing sense of life in the figure.

This commission for the garden of Joseph Hodges Choateâ€™s home, Naumkeag, in Stockbridge was obtained through the architect Sanford White. The statue was to be set into an exterior niche, the shape of the niche determining the curve of the birdâ€™s wings. MacMonniesâ€™s lively imagination invented numerous such unusual subjects, although this one at least recalls traditional images such as Ganymede and the eagle and the youthful Hannibal fighting with the eagle. The figure, both in its realistic representation of a nude adolescent and in its general pose, recalls that of MerciÃ©â€™s David, 1878 in bronze (MusÃ©e dâ€™Orsay, Paris) and, of course, that sculptureâ€™s source in Donatelloâ€™s famous bronze of the same subject in the Bargello, Florence. The intensity with which the details of the birdâ€™s feathers are observed might seem to reflect further study of the character of quattrocento sculpture. At the same time, the sense of a specific modelâ€™s unidealized face and anatomy and of almost excessive liveliness are characteristics of the nudes of MacMonniesâ€™s other master, FalguiÃ¨re. Cortissozâ€™s characterization of MacMonnies and his circle as Neo-Renaissance temperaments strengthened through appreciation of modern French craftsmanship (An American Sculptor, p. 18) captures the spirit of this sculpture. The inventive subject provided material for a richly organized play of positive and negative forms and of curves and countercurves. The forms of boy and bird, distinct in the lower part of the sculpture, are brought into close combination by the way the boyâ€™s proper left arm follows the curve of the wing and his other arm is entwined with the birdâ€™s curving neck. The large curve of his arms is set in equilibrium to the curve of the wings. The play of forms and sense of movement contribute to the sense of liveliness that was characteristic of MacMonniesâ€™s sculptures of the early 1890s. The Young Faun and Heron exhibited in Paris at the 1890 Salon was in plaster and was probably for the life-size fountain statue. It and another 1890 fountain commission, Pan of Rohallion (formerly home of Edward D. Adams, Sea Bright, N.J.), contributed to MacMonniesâ€™s early reputation and led to the important commission of the colossal figures for the Barge of State at the 1893 Worldâ€™s Columbian Exposition. Examples of the half-life-size statuette were favorably received when exhibited in 1891 at the annual exhibition of the Society of American Artists in New York, in 1892 in Saint Louis, and later in 1895 and 1896 in Boston, Philadelphia, and New York. Little of the casting history of the statuette is known. It seems to have been cast, in unknown numbers, by at least two foundries: a proof cast in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and a finished cast in the Cleveland Museum of Art were by Gruet Fondeur, Paris, while the museumâ€™s example was made by Jaboeuf & Rouard, also of Paris.', ''),

I took two small bits of clay and rolled them absentmindedly into two pieces about five inches long. These I pressed together in my closed hand, and studying the result was amazed to find that the pressure of my fingers had clearly suggested the forms of two standing figures. I added the two heads and was tapping the base on the stone step to make it stand up, when Rodin appeared. He asked me what I was doing and I showed him the little group. Just an accident, I said, made while I was waiting for you. After carefully examining it from all sides, he said very seriously, There is more in this than you understand at present .... You will keep this, and model this group one-half life-size and cut it in marble-but before you do it, you must study for five years. In 1912 the clay model was made into a seal five inches high and cast in bronze, with approximately 128 lifetime casts and five posthumous ones. Following Rodinâ€™s advice, Hoffman did not translate the idea of the lovers into a larger scale until about 1917, when she carved two marble examples (private collections). Bronzes of Column of Life were not produced until even later, and their casting history is somewhat complex. The dating of a single bronze cast by Cellini Bronze Works Company, Brooklyn (Art Institute of Chicago), is problematic; it may have been cast as early as 1928 although records in the Hoffman papers list it under 1937. This Cellini bronze is unique in its inclusion of a separately cast, forty-two-inch pedestal with oriental motifs: elaborate low reliefs of six centers of kundalini (chakras) connected by a serpentine form. Not until more than two decades later was another edition cast by Bedi-Rassy Art Foundry, Brooklyn. According to the artistâ€™s account ledgers and foundry receipts, a plaster cast was made in 1959, probably from the marble sold that year to Huntington Hartford. The following year Bedi-Rassy cast a bronze, probably from the 1959 plaster, and it was sold (Glenbow Foundation, Calgary, Alberta, Canada). The foundry also produced a second cast three months before Hoffmanâ€™s death, the museumâ€™s cast. Column of Life exemplifies the strong influence of Rodin on Hoffman during her early years as a sculptor. Rodin created many marbles of lovers embracing, usually presenting the couples as if their bodies were melted together and they had just emerged from the roughly hewn block of stone. Hoffman treated her lovers in a similar manner, also modeling the surface in soft, flowing passages in a manner similar to the sketchy surfaces of Rodinâ€™s sculptures. Such a handling intensified the sensual quality of the theme.', ''),

During the decade this portrait was painted, Raphael also created Double Portrait, 1963 (Mrs. George H. Boynton, Tuxedo Park, N.Y.), which depicts the two sitting in a studio with easels cluttering the background. The quiet, tired poignance of his brother is the sole theme of the painting. Mosesâ€™s mood might have been the result of his advanced age, but it might just as readily be explained by the preferences of both brother-painters for models who expressed a silent and somewhat resigned sadness. In Raphaelâ€™s case this tendency first appeared in the pathos of his scenes of the depression. Raphael often focused on his modelâ€™s face as an expression of this mood, and here placed his brotherâ€™s relatively small head in the center of a large composition. A cool palette of somber mauves, blue greens, and grays intensifies the mood. The emptiness of the room, with only a drawing tacked to a door in the background, emphasizes Mosesâ€™s solitary bearing. Moses is similarly depicted in Raphaelâ€™s most famous late work, Homage to Thomas Eakins, 1963-65 (Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.), a large, crowded group portrait in which all the artists included appear to be en-tranced and in their own worlds despite the crowded nature of the composition. Raphael always demonstrated a strong sense of design, shown here by his strategic placement of the figure.

However, Jewettâ€™s portrait style may have so resembled that of Waldo, his teacher, that they may have been able to work on the likeness together without the slight difference in their personal styles being apparent in the result. Tuckerman wrote that it was a puzzle to the uninitiated to assign to either painter his share of a portrait, and so it remains (Tuckerman 1867, p. 67).  If Jewettâ€™s principal work was in the drapery and backgrounds, the portrait of Mrs. Sackett, being considerably larger than the firmâ€™s usual size of portrait, provided exceptional scope for his abilities. There is considerable space around the figure, who stands in a velvet dress with full lace sleeves, enough space for a table or bracket with a vase of flowers behind her, a table with a large book of engravings atop it in front of her, as well as the distant landscape vista and the vine that softens the transition between the spaces and climbs into the room itself The imagery is that of an elegant interior somehow joined, through the flowers and landscape, with the natural realm, characterizing Mrs. Sackett in terms of the feminine ideal of the romantic period. The conspicuously free handling in the accessories blends imperceptibly with the firmer, but still softened likeness. It is the speaking likeness for which Waldo, and Waldo and Jewett, were known, the impression of an intelligent, friendly personality that looks directly at the viewer in a warm greeting.  It is unfortunate that so little is known about this vividly portrayed personality, this Mrs., or Miss, Sackett. Without knowing her first name, it is a formidable task to identify her among the very large Sackett family. Descendants indicate that she married a General Steward.

The subject, born in 1686, was captain lieutenant, or commanding officer, of Castle William (afterwards Fort Independence) in Boston Harbor for nearly forty years before his death on February 11, 1762. In 1710 he married Elizabeth Jordan, and the couple had three children, a son and two daughters. The younger daughter, Sarah, was born on July 12, 1719. On December 21, 1738, she married Thomas Edes (1715-1794), a ship joiner, or carpenter, of Boston. They had ten children. Thomas Edes was one of the executors of Captain Larrabeeâ€™s will.  An unusual feature of the portrait of Sarah Larrabee Edes is the evidence of significant changes in design, particularly in the position of the hands. Her proper right hand originally was painted as extending further into the lap, and her proper left hand, with its linen sleeve hanging downward, was raised toward her bosom, as though tucking a flower into the neckline, as in Robert Fekeâ€™s Mrs. James Bowdoin II, 1748 (Bowdoin College Museum of Art, Brunswick, Maine).', ''),

The image of the Wandering Jew in art dates back several centuries and took on many levels of meaning, often referring to a person on the fringes of or outside of society. Sigall, who may have been Jewish, might have intended this elderly man to allude to his own emigrations. However, the wanderer was quite an appropriate subject during the Great Depression, during which thousands of people were displaced, some of them forced to live as hobos. In this painting Sigall has presented in quite sympathetic terms an old man who stops to rest and contemplate his situation. A tear stands on his eyelid. Although the background does not seem to be the depiction of a specific locale, the remnants of the front page of a Los Angeles Times in the immediate foreground place the wanderer in the Southern California area. The pictureâ€™s somewhat piecemeal nature gives it a rather naÃ¯ve quality, but Sigallâ€™s meticulously detailed rendering and application of paint in a tempera technique suggest that he was trained in traditional old master methods. Such realistic depiction accords with the revival of Renaissance art that was occurring in American painting at the time. Whether Sigall encountered such art through studies in Europe, South America, or the United States is not known.', ''),

During the late 1930s the artist painted several images of elderly people, endowing each figure with a sense of dignity and strength. Both The Tippler and Time Out, of about the same date (private collection), are half-length figures of robust workmen. While always retaining an impressionist concern for color, Smith painted her mature figure paintings in a darker and richer palette. The silvery gray and purply browns of The Tippler and Time Out enhance the evocation of age and manual labor. Equally rich was Smithâ€™s bravura handling: she built up the form of the man with long, strong strokes of a full brush in the tradition of earlier artists such as WILLIAM M. CHASE and her teacher Tarbell. The unfinished state of the wintry landscape hanging on the back wall to the left further demonstrates the vigor of her handling.', ''),

The version acquired for LACMA in 2011, the year before the artist died, is the artistâ€™s proofâ€?the first impression pulled by the artist.  Catlett was first introduced to the linoleum cut, or linocut, in 1946, when she apprenticed at El Taller de GrÃ¡fica Popular (The Peopleâ€™s Graphic Workshop) in Mexico City. This artistsâ€™ collective, of which Catlett was a member from 1946 to 1966, influenced her commitment to create art that would promote social change and be accessible to broad audiences. Prints, in particular linocuts, were the workshopâ€™s specialty and became Catlettâ€™s preferred medium: they were inexpensive, easy to incise, and conducive to publishing large editions. The linocut is also aesthetically appealing for its smooth, uniform, and clean surface qualities. The vivid contrasts of the black and white markings creating the sharecropperâ€™s weathered skin, textured white hair, and broad brimmed straw hat framing her face are direct and vigorousâ€?and contrast with fatigue evident in the eyes and the large safety pin neatly holding her lightweight jacket closed. These details allude to hardships of sharecropping, an exploitative agricultural system that emerged in the U.S. immediately following the Civil War. Catlettâ€™s image does not shy from this history, nor have other American artists since Reconstruction. In fact, Sharecropper demonstrates the persistence of this theme, namely picking cotton, in American art for both African American and Caucasian artists. LACMAâ€™s collection already included examples by <a href=http://collections.lacma.org/node/184714>Winslow Homer (The Cotton Pickers, 1876)</a>, <a href=http://collections.lacma.org/node/230354>Thomas Hart Benton (Cotton Pickers, 1931)</a>, and <a href=http://collections.lacma.org/node/214850>John Biggers (Cotton Pickers, 1947)</a>. However, Catlettâ€™s Sharecropper is now the museumâ€™s most modern image of American sharecroppers, and one of the artistâ€™s innovations was to remove any visual reference to the cotton field or bags. As a result, Catlettâ€™s interpretation appears more universal and heroic, a portrait of the everywoman sharecropper to whom we look up but who does not meet our gaze.

Hamiltonâ€™s Alexander Masterton and His Wife and Children is a charming and rare example of the conversation piece in early American art. Most fully developed in 18th-century Britain, the conversation piece was a specific type of group portrait that usually depicted a family involved in some everyday activity. The Museumâ€™s conversation piece is unusual for its large scale and the incorporation of landscape and genre painting into portraiture. Its presence in the 19 th-century American art gallery adds a new dimension to the Museumâ€™s collection. When the Scottish-born William Hamilton arrived in this country in the early 1830s, he brought with him this tradition and used it to demonstrate his talent at the annual exhibitions of the National Academy of Design. His 1833 exhibits included an elaborate group portrait of the James Wotherspoon family; so impressive was the painting that Hamilton was elected an Associate member of the esteemed institution â€“ a great honor for someone new to the New York art scene.  The dearth of conversation pieces in American art is surprising since such family portraits reflected the mores of the rising middle class. The majority of the countryâ€™s artists until Hamilton â€™s era created modest bus-and half-length depictions of single figures. Due to the expense full-length portraits were primarily the domain of public, commemorative commissions, while group portraits often appealed to private patrons, who were usually wealthy and prominent men.  Alexander Masterton accumulated a fortune as one of the countryâ€™s major architect-builders, responsible for the construction of the Bank of the United States , the New York Customs House, and many other important public and private buildings in the Greek Revival style. His marble-quarrying firm was so successful that he could afford to buy a country home in Bronxville and to commission this elaborate portrait, two major status symbols of the period. Masterton may have actually brought Hamilton to this country, for he, like the artist and most of Hamilton â€™s other sitters, was Scottish-born.  Hamilton â€™s group portraits were known for their outdoor locales and inclusion of picturesque detail. Prior to Hamilton â€™s arrival, only Ralph Earl, working in late 18th-century Connecticut, repeatedly incorporated landscapes into his portraits. The setting of the Museumâ€™s painting may have been Mastertonâ€™s Bronxville estate, for the portrait remained there with the family until the mid-1980s. Hamilton presented the Masterton family dressed in their Sunday best, enjoying simple country pleasures: the two youngest children remain under the protection of their parents, while the older sons fish, and the family dog takes a nap. The verdant green foliage, garland of flowers, and spacious forest glade all suggest a comfortable life of prosperity and leisure. Ilene Susan Fort. â€œRecent Acquisition.â€?

Born in Paris, but trained in Rome, David had been the most visible artist in France since the return to his country in 1780. The new style he promoted in compositions, remarkable for their clarity and splendid craftsmanship, were revolutionary in many ways: stylistically they offered an alternative to the late Rococo style of David''''s erstwhile teacher, François Boucher. Their moral tone and implied message of support for new political ideals resonated with a large segment of the public. David himself joined the ranks of the revolutionaries, served in the government and put his talent to the service of the new regime. At the end of the French Revolution, David supported the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, eventually rallying to Napoleon and becoming his favorite and official artist. On March 20, 1815 Napoleon, who had been held prisoner on the island of Elba, escaped and arrived in Paris after a sweeping march through France. The following period, known as the 100 days, saw a rapid - but short-lived, re-establishment of Napoleon''''s power. Napoleon did not remain oblivious to the fate of his favorite artist. Reinstated in his position as official painter only five days after Napoleon''''s arrival in Paris, David signed an oath of fidelity to Napoleon, which sealed his political fate when Napoleon''''s defeat at Waterloo on June 15, 1815, triggered the former Emperor''''s abdication. Fearing the consequences of his unconditional dedication to Napoleon, David hastily decamped for Switzerland. Back in Paris in September 1815, the political situation grew uncomfortable for him. In January 1816, Louis XVIII back in power for the second time promulgated an edict condemning the exile of those who, like David, had pledged allegiance to Napoleon. At the end of January 1816, David left for Brussels, where he died in 1825. It was against this political background that David found time to execute the portrait of Jen-Pierre Delahaye, dated and signed 1815 - the last portrait David executed in France. Delahaye was a lawyer who had helped David with the management of his affairs since 1812. At the time of his exile, David appointed him as his proxy in Paris. Delahaye, for instance, handled the sale of David''''s early masterpieces, The Sabine Women and Leonidas at the Thermopylae to Louis XVIII, who wished to acquire them for the Louvre but refused to deal directly with the painter. The exact circumstances of the portrait are unknown. One can imagine that the ties that linked the two men were sufficient to prompt David to execute his friend''''s portrait, perhaps as payment for services rendered. The portrait, never previously exhibited, has since remained in the Delahaye family. The portrait itself is remarkable in representing a personable subject with a great dignity worthy of Roman Republican portraits, the kind David would have studied and admired while a student in Rome. The subject is painted with great economy; the sitter''''s dark jacket and grey-blue vest set off his elaborate white cravat and enhance the subject''''s engaging expression. This remarkable portrait, a major rediscovery and addition to the artist''''s oeuvre completes an important group of paintings of the Revolutionary and Empire periods, already in the museum''''s collection.', ''),

Their vividly portrayed reactionsâ€?from slinking fear and sheer terror to cold confidenceâ€?stand in contrast to the relatively passive human figures, who seem little more than embellishments.  This is an unusual staging of the well-known religious legend of St. George, who killed a dragon terrorizing a royal city in Libya. In Christian theology that episode symbolizes the triumph of good over evil, and illustrations of it normally depict St. George delivering the coup-de-grace. Surand''''s shift from human to animal protagonists suggests a different interest. It reveals some of the tensions that came into play when making an ambitious relevant Salon painting in the late 1880sâ€?tensions between the expectations of academic art, natural science, and visual entertainment. Surand was a master of the academic style, delivering correct drawing, detail realism, and high finish in the service of lifelike illusionism. He was a brilliant and prolific painter of animals, and even his dragon, a figment of the imagination, looks and acts as believably and naturally as the real horse and dogsâ€?possessively guarding its prey and warily eyeing its opponents. Physically, the dragon is a hybrid of various animal species, with an eagle''''s beak, enormous lion paws, an iguana''''s wattle and pointy spinal ridge, and the mosaic-like scales of a snake. This characterization may have been inspired by old, pre-scientific beliefs that dragons were born from the mingled seed of decomposing dead animals; or else by ongoing debates over Darwin''''s theories of evolution and natural selection, and over what fossil and dinosaur-bone finds revealed about extinct species. However, Surand''''s composition was no more intended as a scientific treatise than it was meant to be a religious painting. While its scale and size identified it as a serious work, and while it engaged a current topic, it also delivered the kind of spectacular enchantment viewers had come to expect from large-scale works of art. The picture not only introduced a fantastic yet plausible and up-to-date monster; it also offered an excitingly spiced-up version of the familiar storyâ€?titillating with a dose of delectable nudity and gratuitous gore. In addition, Surand furnished the very real pleasures of a perfectly crafted painting: an elegant palette of pearly grays and earthy golds, and technical bravura that embraces flawless high finish in the figures as well as dynamic free brushwork in the rocks. The painting''''s visual sumptuousness heightens the frisson elicited by the sensational scene. St. George and the Monster adds an original twist to LACMA''''s presentation of the late nineteenth century, anchoring a group of other academic works by Rosa Bonheur, Auguste Glaize, and William-Adolphe Bouguereau. The spectacular aspects of Surand''''s talentâ€?the beauty of style and execution; the fantastic, quasi-scientific interpretation of the story; and, last but not least, the astonishing extravagant dragonâ€?captivate and enchant viewers today as they did in 1888.', ''),

Its subject, Saint Martina, was intimately familiar to the artist, and the young Roman martyr frequently appeared in his work. An architect as well as a painter, Pietro da Cortona designed the church dedicated to the saint in the Roman Forum, executed a famous altarpiece depicting her martyrdom for the Siena Cathedral, and created other compositions in which the saint appears, such as The Madonna and Child with Saint Martina (c. 1645), acquired in 1984 by the Kimbell Art Museum Fort Worth, Texas. Paintings by Cortona can also be found in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and the Ringling Museum of Art, Sarasota, but his work remains rare in American museums. Cortona was a prominent artist and architect of the Roman baroque period. A protÃ©gÃ© of three popesâ€?Urban VIII, Innocent X, and Alexander VIIâ€?he was also the official painter for a number of the wealthiest families in 17th-century Rome. To this day, Cortona''''s fresco ceiling in the Grand Salon of the Palazzo Barberini (now the Galleria Nazionale d''''Arte Antica), painted in 1635, remains a major attraction in Rome. An illusionistic masterpiece, the ceiling is an allegory to the glory of the Barberini family that not only demonstrates Cortona''''s dexterity at organizing a complex composition but also displays his mastery of drawing and use of brilliant colors. Saint Martina was a Roman virgin believed to have been martyred in the year 226 or 228 for her unwavering commitment to her Christian faith. Cortona has portrayed her in this painting as the embodiment of health and beauty even though she is said to have suffered numerous tortures, including being hung on a hook, before she was ultimately beheaded. Here she is shown holding the hook as well as a palm frond, a traditional symbol of saintly martyrdom; her right arm rests on a fallen structure, a reference to the Roman idols she refused to worship. Saint Martina is one of the many generous gifts made by The Ahmanson Foundation to LACMA. The Foundation has continually supported the acquisitions of LACMA''''s Department of European Painting. LACMA Director Michael Govan said, The Ahmanson Foundation has been the most consistent and generous donor to the museum in its history. Over the years, it has been through its support that the museum has been able to add masterworks by such artists as Guido Reni, Georges de La Tour, and Jacques-Louis David.', ''),

Following the example of both Jacopo and Giovanni Bellini, Cima painted moving images of the Madonna and Child in compositions remarkable for their hieratic presence.  Departing from the paintings of the Bellini and their workshop, which were based on Byzantine models, Cima''''s compositions are full of life and naturalism evidenced in the poetic landscapes he uses as backgrounds. A sublime example of the artist''''s production in the last decade of the 15th century, the painting shows the Mother watching carefully over the Child precariously balanced over her lap. In the background, a small hill town may be the painter''''s own hometown of Conegliano, and to the left are featured scenes from the life of Mary including the Flight into Egypt, and the Visitation.

Born in a large family of painters whose best-known member is, atypically, his sister, Louise Moillon, a remarkable painter of still life that, to this day, appeal to collectors of Northern paintings, Isaac achieved considerable fame in his lifetime. As the main designer of cartons or models for the Aubusson tapestry manufactory, he occupied a semi official position in the highly structured artistic life of seventeenth century France. As a painter, Moillon worked for the Church (in spite of his belonging to the Reformed Faith) â€? one of his main commissions being the decoration of the Hotel Dieu at Beaune â€? and for a small group of enlightened provincial aristocrats in the regions of Auvergne and Limousin, in central France. His only recorded decoration for a hotel in Paris, on the spot currently occupied by the Bibliotheque Nationale, did not survive. The reconstruction of his work began in the early 1980''''s (culminating in an exhibition and major catalogue in 2005) and has thus far yielded an original body of work whose existence challenges our established notion of classicism. While his paintings reveal subtle affinities with the works of some of his contemporaries, Laurent de la Hyre and Jacques Stella (artists represented in LACMA''''s collection) in particular, they are also striking for their originality and elegance. Particularly remarkable are the decorations done by Isaac Moillon in the early 1650''''s for various chateaus in the Auvergne. Sophonisbe Drinking Poison seems to belong to this group. The subject of Queen Sophonisba drinking poison rather than being paraded in the Roman triumph of her victor, Scipio Africanus, was much in favor in French literary circles at the time Moillon executed this painting. Plays by Jean Mairet (1634), Georges de Scudery and Pierre Corneille (1663) had made the theme popular with the public. What links this painting to the decorations Isaac Moillon executed â€? also in 1653 â€? for the Chateau of Saint Quintin sur Sioule is not only their similar style, but also their subject illustrating heroic women: Sophonisba, Porcia (committing suicide by eating coals), and Esther fainting before Ahasuerus. The painting''''s striking figures, clear colors, and elegant details such as the carpet or the huge â€? almost neoclassic urn, evoke a form of mannerism that seems anachronistic with the date of the painting, 1653. Indeed Moillon adopts here a narrative form that is as opposed as can be imagined from the solemn and severe classicism of Poussin at the same time. It is also quite different from Moillon''''s own previous style at Beaune in the mid 1640Â’s. There, Moillon''''s sturdier figures belong more fully to the prevalent French classical canon. The stylistic shift remains unexplained and seems to have been dictated more by the subject than by any other reason. This very rare painting adds to the museum''''s important collection of seventeenth century French painting and adds a fresh, unexpected â€? indeed unique â€? note to it. There are no other paintings by the artist in any other American museum.', ''),

Upon its completion, many connoisseurs visited Henner''''s studio to see specifically the painting which the artist refused to exhibit publicly at the 1880 Salon, a decision that added without doubt to the aura that surrounded the work. Henner is better known today for his many versions of academic nudes in misty landscapes, a genre that he developed toward the end of the nineteenth century and that brought him international fame. Earlier in his career, he was however one of the most sought-after painters of religious subjects and of portraits. Among the portrait painters of his generation, Henner developed a distinctive style. Less voluptuous than Carolus- Duran''''s but more spirited than LÃ©on Bonnat''''s, Henner''''s portraits were particularly appealing to a clientele eager to display in a dignified manner their newly acquired wealth and social rank. As in this portrait, Henner typically set the sitter against a plain background so as to enhance the subject''''s fine features. In this portrait, Madame Duchesne-Fournet''''s black outfit is thinly painted in a manner prefiguring Whistler,but the austere atmosphere of the composition also recalls the full-size portraits of van Dyck and Goya.

Isaac was the brother of the better-known Louise Moillon, a painter of still-lifes established in Paris in the first half of the seventeenth century.  Both were children of Nicolas Moillon, himself a â€“ now forgotten â€“ artist. Still-life was considered a minor genre in seventeenth century France.  For that reason few painters devoted their talent to painting the material world. As a woman, and as a Calvinist, Louise Moillon was, socially-speaking, an outsider; the otherness of her condition may have as a result to helped to abolish some of the strictures that regulated artistic life.  She enjoyed great success, her paintings being already perceived as an answer to the challenge posed to French artists by their Northern colleagues, the undisputed masters in the field.  Moillon brings starkness to her composition that is entirely hers:  here for instance, the simplicity of the subject matter is reinforced by a powerful play of light that evokes even the art of Caravaggio â€“ an unlikely source of inspiration for an artist who never traveled.  Moillonâ€™s compositions are not emblematic and do not contain hidden religious meanings yet their simplicity evoke a spiritual world that echoes some of the most austere religious movements of the seventeenth century whether the Jansenist movement (illustrated pointedly in the portraits of Philippe de Chanmpaigne), or Moillonâ€™s own Calvinism. Moillonâ€™s work enjoyed success not only in her lifetime:  more recently, her stark pictures appealed to collectors of both Dutch pictures and modern art.  Basket of Peaches, Quinces and Plums offers a wonderful complement to Georges de La Tourâ€™s The Magdalen with the Smoking Flame and would illustrate the diversity of French painting under Louis XIII.

Unusually for a woman, her work also included religious and mythological subjects.  She was born into an artistic family in 1552.  Her father, Prospero Fontana (1512-1597) was an enlightened Mannerist painter known as much for his paintings, many of which betray his apprenticeship under Vasari, as for his passion for literature and his taste for antiques which he collected.  Laviniaâ€™s early education took place in this refined milieu.  Rapidly she was able to negotiate the complicated paths and obstacles set in front of her:  as a woman she learned how to navigate the complexities of personal rank, as well as admittance by peers, connoisseurs and dealers.  Devout, she married and had many children:  she was proud of being an exemplary mother while gaining recognition and even popularity.  Her fame reached Rome.  In 1604, Pope Clement VII called her there.  Her later years in Rome were marked by success as well.                 This fine â€œSacra Conversazioneâ€? ranks among the most accomplished works of the painter.  Its softness â€“ which owes much to both Raphael and Correggio, sets it apart from many of her paintings in which the artist continues the decorative and somewhat stiff manner of her father.  Indeed this may have had to do with Laviniaâ€™s intention to participate in the Counter Reformation movement and to follow carefully the suggestions of the Bolognese Cardinal Paleotti (1522 1597) whose treatise Discorso intorno alle immagini sacre e profane (1592) was a manual intended to explain the clarity and simplicity required by the Council of Trent in the treatment of religious images.  Here Lavinia clearly attempts to reform the Mannerist tradition and to introduce through emotional interaction and expressive gestures the kind of art capable of â€œmoving the spiritâ€? recommended by Cardinal Paleotti.

Rather, TrÃ¼bnerâ€™s attention to the atmospheric variability of nature came out of the tradition of Munich plein-air painting: TrÃ¼bner began to study art in 1869 at the Akademie der schÃ¶nen KÃ¼nste in Munich, which at the time was the undisputed art capital of Germany. Outside of the academy, he also quickly became involved with the circle of artists around Wilhelm Leibl, a group of painters with anti-academy leanings who were greatly influenced by the French Realist Gustave Courbet, and devoted to Courbetâ€™s brand of naturalism. The artists of the Leibl circle (which also included Hans Thoma, whose painting The Spring LACMA acquired in 2008) focused on portraits, still lifes, and landscape compositions. They also developed a notion of pure painting, in which color and formal qualities were their primary focus, outweighing the requirements of traditional subjects and conventional composition schemes. TrÃ¼bner was primarily a figure painter. He created ambitious scenes from history and literature, but also genre compositions and portraits, notably an extraordinary series of life-size plein-air equestrian portraits. Arguably, however, it is in TrÃ¼bnerâ€™s landscape paintings, more modest in scale and subject, that his sense of experimentation and innovation is most consistently realized. TrÃ¼bner turned to landscape painting in the early 1870s, joining his friend Carl Schuch in exploring various locations around Munich. One of his favorite sites became Lake Chiemsee, already in the nineteenth century a popular tourist destination in Upper Bavaria. TrÃ¼bner first visited the Chiemsee in 1873, but over the years returned numerous times to paint a series of views on the lakeâ€™s two main islands, Frauenchiemsee and Herrenchiemsee. The 1891 painting Frauenchiemsee is one of two that depict the same striking vista of the Benedictine convent on the island; its sturdy bell tower and white buildings are seen from a low vantage point across an expansive meadow. The convent was founded in the eighth century and rebuilt in the early eighteenth century. In the early nineteenth century it was secularized, but reinstated by King Ludwig I in 1836. Dedicated to girlsâ€™ education, the convent buildings are still in use, looking very much like they do in TrÃ¼bnerâ€™s painting. However, TrÃ¼bnerâ€™s composition is not a picture postcard. Avoiding the conventions of the picturesque mode, it offers an original, painterly take on the scene. The pictureâ€™s most striking features are the idiosyncratically dramatized perspective and the vigorously brushed foreground, behind which the motif itself, the historic site, seems almost incidental. TrÃ¼bnerâ€™s earlier tonal palette, so typical of the Leibl circle, now has given way to a brighter, more intense range of colors, and his technique has taken on a characteristic steady rhythm of short, straight strokes that generate the pictorial structure. The brilliant play of colors â€“ blue against white against bright green and dark green â€“ and the energetic but fluid gesture are his primary subject.  A first glance at Frauenchiemsee may bring to mind the art of Vincent Van Gogh, particularly in respect to the almost abstract brushwork in the meadowâ€™s darker half, where vivid green paint is lushly applied wet-in-wet. The meaning of this darker zone is unclear: it might be read as the shadow of a cloud overhead or the effect of a wind gust flattening long grasses; or, very possibly, as a mainly formal device intended to heighten the visual and expressive force of the picture â€“ something Van Gogh would have understood. However, although TrÃ¼bner had been in Paris in 1879 and 1889 for the Universal Expositions (even participating in the 1889 Exposition and garnering an honorable mention), there is no indication that he was even aware of the Dutch artist. At the time, Van Goghâ€™s work was still very rarely shown and virtually unknown even in Paris. Much more so in Germany, where a first exhibition of Van Goghâ€™s paintings, at the Galerie Paul Cassirer in Berlin, was a revelation in 1902. TrÃ¼bner, who in the course of his career, published several essays about contemporary art in general and his own painting in particular, did not deal with Van Gogh at length until an article in 1915. Tellingly, he there ranked Van Gogh as a genius of only the second order: an outstanding, highly gifted colorist, who, however, in TrÃ¼bnerâ€™s estimation, fell sadly short in the area of technical proficiency, lacking the skill to create a sense of form. Undoubtedly, this assessment reveals less about Van Gogh than about TrÃ¼bnerâ€™s own position as a painter in the early twentieth century: as a modern colorist who eschewed the strict descriptiveness of academic art; but also did not subscribe to impressionismâ€™s dissolution of form, or to expressionismâ€™s subjective distortion.

Kalmus (54.6)', 'Rosso Fiorentino was trained in the Florentine High Renaissance tradition, but reacted against its emphasis on beauty, balance, and harmony. As an early mannerist artist, he instead painted asymmetrical, emotionally charged compositions. His work was admired by the poet Aretino, and Rosso was named painter to the king of France. He died in France, possibly by suicide. The subject of this unfinished painting is still unknown. The woman in blue at the right is the Virgin; she holds the frightened Christ Child in her arms. At the left the young Saint John the Baptist reclines in a troubled sleep and almost appears to be dead. The identity of the old woman at the left is unclear. She may be Saint Anne (mother of the Virgin), Saint Elizabeth (mother of John the Baptist), or a Sibyl from classical mythology who foretold the future. This haunting image is one of the museum''''s masterpieces. Mannerist artists often were influenced by other works of art. Here Rosso portrayed the young Saint John in a posture reminiscent of the dead Christ in Michelangelo''''s Piet , a source easily recognized by viewers of the day, but Rosso abstracted the figures to project an intensely personal vision. His rapid application of the paint, more noticeable because the painting is unfinished, reinforces the work''''s uneasy urgency and visionary quality.', ''),

Because the Dutch Reformed Calvinism of his time forbade religious art in churches, public commissions for paintings of biblical subjects were virtually nonexistent, but an enthusiastic private patronage for them thrived, which helps account for the preponderance of religious subjects in Rembrandt''''s work. The Raising of Lazarus is Rembrandt''''s only painting of this miracle marking the culmination of Christ''''s ministry, but he also made drawings and etchings of the same subject. Christ''''s divine and human nature is revealed as he stands in the cave where Lazarus was buried, his hand raised to perform the miracle, his face filled with apprehension and triumph. Rembrandt interprets Lazarus''''s rising not only in direct correspondence with Christ''''s forceful gesture but also in response to the divine power it has unleashed by evoking faith. Around Christ and the tomb huddle the astounded witnessesâ€?among them Mary and Martha, Lazarus''''s sistersâ€?whose gestures and expressions record successive states of awareness and awe before what is unfolding. The dramatic darkness of the cave does not obscure the subtle colors--mauve, rose, and aqua--of the costumes or the glinting highlights of the quiver and scabbard hanging at the right.', ''),

In his lifetime his work appeared in the prominent royal collections of Europe. La Tour''''s early training is still a matter for speculation, but in the province of Lorraine he encountered the artist Jean Le Clerc, a follower of the Italian painter Caravaggio. From this source likely came La Tour''''s concern with simplicity, realism, and essential detail. Mary Magdalen was traditionally depicted in her grotto or as an aged woman. The absence of explicit narrative in this painting emphasizes Mary''''s state of mind and heart rather than time and place. The simple composition of vertical and horizontal shapes draws the viewer into the Magdalen''''s contemplative world. The skull, books of Scripture, and scourge set the mood, but the chief symbol and true subject of the work is the candle at which Mary gazes in her meditation. Rendered in extraordinary detail and modulation, it emits the light that followers of St. John of the Cross called the living flame of love, toward which spiritual pilgrims are drawn out of the dark night of the soul. La Tour scrupulously conveys the tactile quality of surfaces. The polished skull and leather books have different reflective qualities; Mary''''s heavy skirt, thin, wrinkled blouse, smooth flesh, and hair are meticulously distinct. Each spare detail is carefully regulated to achieve an overall balance of form and light.', ''),

He was admitted to the French Royal Academy as a still-life painter in 1728, a rare honor, as still life was then considered far less valid than paintings of historical, mythological, or courtly subjects. Even though his work reflected the ordinary images, decorum, and morality of the bourgeois life from which he came, Chardin''''s talent was recognized in artistic and aristocratic circles. Chardin began to paint genre subjects in the late 1730s, evoking through his observation of everyday life a contemplative atmosphere that in France had largely remained the domain of religious painting. In some ways his compositions heralded the values of the art of the Enlightenment, with its emphasis on rational content, naturalistic imagery, and qualities of truth and directness in subject matter. Soap Bubbles is carefully composed in the simplest of geometries, with the window forming a rectangular space to frame the pyramidal grouping of the youth and the boy transfixed by the spherical bubble; these shapes are reinforced by the masonry, angles of the youth''''s arms, and the pair of heads. Chardin renders surfaces carefully but without distracting detail. A sense of timeless contemplation transforms the ephemeral pastime of the pair into a compelling allegory about the transitory nature of life. This is far from being a scene of carefree, youthful abandon.', ''),

Like them, Reni drew on history, mythology, and religion for subjects for his narrative paintings, the kind most prestigious and in demand during his time. Nevertheless he completed several portrait commissions; his depiction of Cardinal Roberto Ubaldino is one of the most vivid formal portraits of the seventeenth century. It may show the influence of van Dyke''''s celebrated portrait style. The cardinal''''s pose is traditional, established by Raphael''''s and Titian''''s earlier portraits of popes. In its clear and carefully balanced composition the work emulates paintings by Raphael, Reni''''s idol, yet the cardinal is not idealized. Reni''''s desire for classical idealization is balanced by a seventeenth-century literalness that attempted a faithful transcription of the cardinal''''s physical and psychological presence. A cousin of Pope Leo XI and an envoy of Pope Paul V, Cardinal Ubaldino, a subtle and astute diplomat, was papal nuncio to Paris in the early 1620s. He may have commissioned this portrait for the Jubilee of 1625. The cardinal is portrayed before a theatrical swag of drapery; a grand arcade recedes into the distance, providing a view of a formal garden and the park beyond. The setting, accessories, and brilliant play of reds and scarlets combined with the superb rendering of delicate lace contribute to an image of the cardinal as a man of refinement and power.', ''),

There is evidence that this figure of Raphael was once accompanied by that of Tobias. The Book of Tobias in the Apocrypha tells of a beautiful young man, actually Raphael, who offered to travel with Tobias on his first journey away from home to recover a debt owed his poor, aged father. With the angel''''s care and instruction Tobias met and overcame many hazards.  This figure''''s graceful beauty and slender proportions link it with the late Renaissance (about 1550â€?1600) style, in which the unsettling character of mannerist art (c. 1525-50) gave way again to classicizing balance. The technique used to color the angel''''s tunic, imitating brocade, is called graffito. The wood sculpture is covered with gold leaf and then painted; designs are then incised in the paint to reveal patterns in the gold.  Raphael''''s upward-pointing hand indicates his divine mission and serves as a reminder of faith in God. His sandals, girdle, and tunic recall Roman military dress, a reference to the archangels'''' identity as a powerful paladin of Christ. While his stance and backward-flowing drapery can be interpreted as a forward stride, the angel''''s body is not thrust forward, and the edges of his elaborate robes curl up unexpectedly, creating the sensation that he is surrounded by the spiritual wind that indicated special holiness in earlier Christian art. Despite the beauty of this magnificent sculpture, the identity of its creator remains unknown.', ''),

In style and subject matter it reflects the neoclassical taste for perfection. The philosophers of the Age of Reason believed that man and society, through the systematic study and emulation of both classical learning and arts, could return to a Golden Age paralleling that of classical antiquity. Deare''''s relief embodies this ideal.  Deare''''s scene is from Homer''''s Iliad, a literary source for which contemporary archaeological discoveries had created renewed interest. The enthroned Jupiter sits among the gods at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis (at left), to which all except the goddess of discord, Eris, were invited. The spiteful Eris tossed a golden apple inscribed to the fairest among the guests, and Minerva, Juno, and Venus each claimed it. Jupiter, refusing to pick the most beautiful of this formidable trio, has handed the apple to his messenger, Mercury, who flies above, giving him instructions to pass it, and the thankless task, to the mortal prince, Paris. Deare represents the three goddesses challenging Jupiter. Paris''''s decision will ultimately lead to the Trojan War, here evoked by Mars, god of war, shown at the far right.  Deare''''s carving varies from nearly flat background figures to others almost completely in the round, a Renaissance technique that gives the illusion of three-dimensional space. The forms of the bodies are idealized, smooth, and refined. This is the most important English neoclassical relief in the United States.', ''),
